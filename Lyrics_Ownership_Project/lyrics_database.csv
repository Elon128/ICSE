Blue Eyes,Yo Yo Honey Singh,"[Chorus]
Blue Eyes hypnotise teri kardi ai mainu
I swear choti dress mein bomb lagdi mainu
Glossy Lips, uff, yeh tricks, baby lagdi ai killer
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah katal kare tera bomb figure
Blue Eyes hypnotise teri kardi ai mainu
I swear choti dress mein bomb lagdi mainu
(Bomb lagdi mainu, bomb lagdi mainu, mainu)
[Verse 1]
Meri aankhon mein dekha kar jab mein baat karta hu
Main wo londa nhi jo tere sath padta hu
White Ginni laya hu, tujhe pic karlu
Dekh lunga aashiq or teri teacher nu
Leke chalu ride pe fir chath kholke
Seedhi baat karu, na karu tolmol ke
Tonight, I gotta hold you tight
Aaj hogi late phone karke ghar pe bolde
[Chorus]
Blue Eyes hypnotise teri kardi ai mainu
I swear choti dress mein bomb lagdi mainu
Glossy Lips, uff, yeh tricks, baby lagdi ai killer
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah katal kare tera bomb figure
[Verse 2]
Ghar pe chalna hai ya pehle jayegi club?
Nahi, mera matlab, ghar ke club?
Tab lunga left, nahin toh right
Club mien hoga shor, baby, ghar pe pillow fight
You decide ke kya karna hai
Tujko to zara sa bhi darna hai
Champagne ger di hai tune meri pant pe
Kehti hai change karlo hotel lekar rent pe
[Chorus]
Blue Eyes hypnotise teri kardi ai mainu
I swear choti dress mein bomb lagdi mainu
Glossy Lips, uff, yeh tricks, baby lagdi ai killer
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah katal kare tera bomb figure
[Verse 3]
Suna tere college mein mere gaane ban hai
Padne-likhne ka tera na koi plan hai
Pass kradu, phone Ghumadu
Teri Principal bhi baby Yo Yo ki fan hai
Teri Principal bhi baby Yo Yo ki fan hai
Kehndi Yo Yo Honey singh
[Chorus]
Blue Eyes hypnotise teri kardi ai mainu
I swear choti dress mein bomb lagdi mainu
Glossy Lips, uff, yeh tricks, baby lagdi ai killer
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah katal kare tera bomb figure
Blue Eyes hypnotise teri kardi ai mainu
I swear choti dress mein bomb lagdi mainu
(Bomb lagdi mainu, bomb lagdi mainu, mainu)"

Your glossy lipper, mere lai some liquor
Kar na koi fikar, just do it everything quicker

Naal mere lai pack kar, thodi roti te bhindi
Aaj rab ne sukh naal saara kaam banata ai
Tere maa-peya nu vi time se suaata ai
Tere doggy nu main nashe waala biscuit paata ai
Excited main edda, Excited main edda
Excited main edda, honeymoon package book kara ta ai

Love Dose,Yo Yo Honey Singh,"Lagdi mainu jivein ambraan di queen

Iss chashme ko hata do
Aankhon ko mila lo
Aankhon ke nashile jaam
Aankhon se pila do
Lagta hum pehle mile
Ya ho mujhe Déjà vu

Girl I'm talking to you
Ab aankhon se hataya chashma
Aakhein to milaao ji
Duniya waale jo bhi bole
Humse na sharmaao ji
Ab phone utthaao ji
Aur daddy ki millo ji
Unke future son-in-law ki baat unse karwaao ji
""Hello, Uncle, namaste""
Chalo kaam ki baat pe aatein hain
Ab aap ye puchhenge ki
Aap kitne paise kamate hain?
Bas jitna aapki beti
Ek mahine mein udati hai
Ek hafte me meri gaadi utna tel khaati hai
Hai ghar, hai paisa, hai gaadi
Ab do jodon mein ladki bhejo
Ladki hui hamaari
Uncle hai ghar, hai paisa, hai gaadi
Ab do jodon mein ladki bhejo
Ladki hui humaari, OK Bye

Manali Trance,Yo Yo Honey Singh,"(Intro)
Ahh... Why do I even waste my time?
I've been on dating sites, tried speed dating, I've tried getting a wingman...
And I simply got no game, you know what I'm sayin'?
And I got no one else to blame but myself, y'know?
Check this out
(verse 1)
I'm feelin' fed up as I browse through a dating site
Tryna find the one lady I can call ""Mrs. Right""
But all I get are frights and the ones who rhyme with ""bikes""
And the ones who only wanna ride my spike for one night
I'm vexed, fuming, my patience is shot
And don't even get me started on the thot bots
Let me be clear: I'm not here to put on the ""nice guy"" spiel
I'm not entitled to a girl's attention, I know the deal
If I message a girl, I'm not gonna dog her
Or if I get dissed, I won't commit an Elliot Roger
But it's bad enough most girls online think I'm a scrub
All these doms be hitting me up to be their kowtowing sub
Or they think I'm packing, just cuz I'm black
Want me to bang em in front of their man -- what kinda ish is that?!
I try to kick a cool line, and be kind
But ghosts are the only thing I seem to find
But instead of shooting up a school, I'll just kick a rhyme to let ya know what's on my mind
And oftentimes, I find that the issue is me, cuz I'm often lame
And no dame wants a brother who got no game, know what I'm saying?
(chorus x2)
No game (no game) x2
Bro, Vadell, man, you way too lame
No, game (no game) x2
Bro, Vadell, man, that's such a shame
(verse 2)
The worst part of being lame is that you're constantly cucked
Takes no effort to obstruct you from the girl you're trying to see
Take it from me, The Yangsta does this all the time
Even when I manage to impress a girl with my rhymes
But what little shine I get, he always takes
Doesn't even try to seduce the girls I date
Maybe it's my fate to be single. The thought itself hurts
But who really wants to be with an introvert?
Yangsta got finesse, looks, a car, and money
While I'm like Hev, I got nuttin' but love for ya, honey
I bet Lex is holding her head down in shame
Cuz I'm too lame to tell these girls to peep game
But it's hard when your game is outshined by another's
By a man who you often call your brother
And really, it's not that I try to little or too hard
I'm just a Charmander, while he's a Charizard
(chorus x2)
(Verse 3 - Yangsta)
My bad, bro, I cramped your style
I stole your girl with just one smile
Man, that's awkward, cuz you're my boy
But I'm your cockblocker, I stole your joy
I know you're annoyed by the way that I flex
You'll win too, bro, I promise you're next
No need to stress, all good baby baby
When you progress, you're gonna find your lady
And she's gonna love the dumb things you say
And appreciate your silly, troll-ass ways
And as for me, karma comes full circle
Perhaps one day, I'll be in a role reversal
I'll meet somebody that makes me go cray
Then another dude pulls up, and sweeps her away
And that's just life, no one else to blame
For clowning my boy, cuz having no game
(chorus x2)
(Outro - Vadell)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, hold up, hold up!
How you gonna hop on my track like that man?!
First you steal my girls from me that I'm trying to date, then you hop on my own track and murder me on my own shit!
Can't you let me have something for... (angry groaning)
Man... I can't believe this shit...
Man, why you gotta do that to me, man?
(Groan) I'm out, peace"
Dope Shope,Yo Yo Honey Singh,"Ehna vi na dope shope mareya karo

Jisne bhi party hai karni, aa jao mere ghar ke bheetar
Daaru, liquor, khaane ko hai murga teetar
Noida, Gurgaon, Dilli ki chhoriyan aayi hain
Saath mein Yo Yo ki CDiyaan bhi laayi hain
Sawaari saman ki, ib khud zimmedar hain
Kar lo party sari raat, kal itwaar hai
Music bajega loud, to aunty police bula legi
Ib aunty ne ja ke keh do, yeh party yun hi chalegi

Sun lo sari duniya waalon

Karenge party sari raat
Gaand mein dum hai to band karva lo

Daaru shaaru ghullan do
Whisky da peg laga ke..

Khulli daaru, khulla khana, har koi bole ghar nahi jaana
Daddy ko tu kar de message, aaja ri kar ke bahana
Party ho ri bahut bhayankar, party ke ghajab nazaare
Dikkat hai bas ek baat ki, gaaon mein hai kai taau kanware
Nikkar waali chhori ne ye, vodka chadha rakhi hai
Ek khatam na ho ri is-se, doosri mangwa rakhi hai
Naache dekh ri kaise, aag si laga rakhi hai
Itti si tu hai nahi, huh!, aafat macha rakhi hai

Yaar Naa Miley,Yo Yo Honey Singh,"One thousand miles gaddi drive karke aaya
Tere ghar pe, main tere ghar pe

Is it life, I want, I could’t understand
Saari raat, teri raah udigde mere nain

Ab hona jo bhi ho jaaye
Rab di sau eh doori na hun sehni main
Haan naa hun sehni main

Chaar baje ka apne ghar se
Main apne ghar se

Tabhi to jitni bhi kaali clothing thi

Teri yaad tadpaave gaddi shool uddi jaave
Gaddi te gaddi te gaddi over take kari jaave
Ek hazaar mile lamba faasla tha baby

One Bottle Down,Yo Yo Honey Singh,"[Round 1: Real Deal]
You two are in trouble
You better hope Christ don't carry a grudge and count your Jewish rebuttals
Now Dirtbag I'm getting pissed, you're on my shit list
Real talk I'm getting pissed
You'll be on it, once I get you off of Schindler's List
[Fresco]
Yo, yo, yo, he is a dirtbag (oh yeah?)
But that's because he cocks his mother
If he wanted something hot for supper he'd have to lock and cuff her
He said he wanted to stop last winter, he didn't want a brother
Until he got a box of rubbers as a stocking stuffer
[Real Deal]
Oy vey! Soul Khan you've been losing battles a lot
And since you're Jewish you can appreciate how much your value has dropped
But me? I'm ahead of my game
Your style should come patented with Rhetoric's name
And Dan, how come you look like a vagabond but your wife's always the one catching the train?
[Fresco]
Oh, oh, that's prolly cause this motherfucker was born in a manger
(Real talk?)
Not cause he's a Lord or a savior
His parents just thought that that shit was normal behavior
Yo fuck that, your Jewish bargaining tactics are never gonna work
Try to haggle me for a Real Deal and ended up with Dirt
[Round 1: Soul Khan]
This shit's a vacation for me, I'm in the O to burn my salary
We can shave our beards, Real Deal can't grow a personality
Yo, he a good dude though, I'd hate to give him second place
They say nice guys finish last...all over Fresco's face
[Dirtbag Dan]
This kid got kicked out seminary for gay sex
And this guy looks like 80% of every preliminary rape sketch
Aye, tell your buddy K-Fed to get an AIDS test and don't lie
He's one of those dudes that raped you on that pinball machine in Boys Don't Cry
[Soul Khan]
Now Fresco the type of dude to get AIDS by reflex
And then drop a clothing line called H.I.V. necks
Yo, we California bred, how the fuck are we supposed to fear
A Pittsburgh Pirate and a rectal Buccaneer
[Dirtbag Dan]
Stop stop
Hey, let's be honest
I'm feeling Kid Caustic's wordplay
Wait a minute, you're not Caustic, he has more of a bird face
[Round 2: Real Deal]
Yo, motherfucka...fuck it, whatever you was rapping was weak
He's from Woodland Hills, they named it after his cheek
Let that shit sink in a little bit
[Fresco]
Yo, yo check it out
This is how we Jew it
Yo, yo he knows Jew-jitsu and Jew-do
Your favorite movie is Juno
You back that ass up listening to Jew-vie
In a pair of pink daisy dukes that say Jew-cy
[Real Deal]
Hey, this motherfucker was frozen in ice for most of his life
So he ain't prepared to battle
I flew from Florida, Southwest
He flew south east on a pterodactyl
[Fresco]
And that fact that you shaved your beard means you're not so smart
Looking like you fuck dudes on the down low dressed as Groucho Marx
[Real Deal]
Did you know Soul Khan's a fiend?
And he rolls with his dealer here, ahh Dustface
He thinks he plays ball cause he gotta slide in Dirt to touch base
You grew a playoff beard but you suck at every damn sport
I'll take a shit in your Brown Bag and burn it on Dan's porch
[Fresco]
Eh, fuck your entire verse Simon Birch
Go get your tools up
Help rebuild Jebodiah's church or fucking drown in a school bus faggot
[Round 2: Dirtbag Dan]
Our battle, was a classic match up between two of the finest
Your battle, was a one sided rape fest; domestic violence
[Soul Khan]
Don't ever you fucking mention Brown Bag in your lines
I sold motherfucking more records than both you faggots combined!
[Soul Khan]
Y'all heard Real Deal's music? Like the Plight of Trevor Weller
All your beats sound like they produced by motherfucking Hellen Keller
I've heard of generic motherfuckers, he's as plain as they come
You're Trevor, your kid's Trevor, you even suck at naming your son
[Dirtbag Dan]
How original is he with the names?
I mean, Real Deal, original ain't that?
About as original as a Myspace photo shoot of you writing raps on the train tracks
[Soul Khan]
I say this, if Fresco's tracks, that shit'll just paid for y'all
I'd rather get kicked in the taint or balls than listen to Clarisa explain it all
And you ever making gay jokes with yo' feminine habits
Well that's like the pot calling the kettle a faggot
[Dirtbag Dan]
Honestly, I feel like we're giving him a thrashing
We should be giving him a thrashing
He takes so much dastardly dick
When he takes a shit it sounds like Muttley laughing
[Soul Khan]
And I know this might sound a little homophobic
But you're the only dude I know who's ever owned a glow stick
[Round 3: Fresco]
Yo, yo, yo I don't wanna battle with you two fucking hoes
That Muttley line's dope, Madness told it to me two months ago
Soul you're a sad soul
When he thinks when Dan raps it's a bitch
Cause every time he cuts you off you have a flashback to your bris
[Real Deal]
Soul Khan smells like shit, honestly foul
I told dude, ""Get in the shower"" and tossed him a towel
He said, ""Uh huh. You fooled my people once I won't fall for it now.""
I bet you karaoke Adam Sandler's Hanukkah song and you know every word
Picture him at gay bars, showing up slurred
Louis and Ogre from Nerds
[Fresco]
Aye, but we had his Jewish broad
She was tasting the cock
And after three hours of breaking her box
We had her down on all fours puking up bagels and lox
See, you're gay as AIDS and you suck in the cipher
And you're David Spade after a month of Survivor
But lost your razor blade when you were hunting a tiger
[Real Deal]
I think this Virgin Mary needs a purse to carry
And when it comes to rappers, you make Dumbfoundead look as much as a mercenary as fucking Dirty Harry
And you're not getting pussy, blame them
And if the shit isn't clear...look who the fuck's face is on the flier and look how many women in here
And when Soul Khan's piping Dan, he's like, ""Chill out when you start to take it.""
While he's target aiming on his tramp stamp of the Star Of David
[Round 3: Soul Khan]
You honey drippers ain't a match for Daniel and Khan
Here's your relationship in three words, Bed, Bath & Beyond
Time been tough for Real Deal he been feeling wrecked by the stress or nah-
He been wrecked by the stress building
Until he got a job as a bodyguard protecting Perez Hilton
[Dirtbag Dan]
This motherfucker was in the 'Zay trying to get chicks and he got all bitter
Cause they were like, ""Let's go fuck."" And he was like, ""Nah, let's go scissor.""
Honestly, when it comes to me and Khan beating y'all, bro no prob
And I appreciate y'all trying to grow facial hair, we call that ""homoflage""
[Soul Khan]
I got the voice of a goddamn beast
You got the voice of a drama coach
Here's the Real Deal
Five bucks for five nuts in yo' mama's throat
And I'll say this, they asked me for a favor
I'd be an asshole if I said no
So by the power invested in me I now pronounce you man and Fresco
[Round 4: Fresco]
Yo, yo, yo this motherfucking rabbi's pathetic
Every time he performs the entire crowd turns anti-semitic
If he needs attention he has to go on a chatline to get it
Cause ass from a black guy is something you can't buy with credit
[Real Deal]
Dirt, Dirt, real talk, how long are you arms?
Cause that'd make a perfect addition to the cross in my yard
And I swear to God, Grind Time has got us rap battling faggots
Thanks for this wack album of trash Zach Galifianakis
[Fresco]
Aye, I could fire in the sky like it's not for no reason
Pop, your dome's leaking, my shots are Soul seeking
[Real Deal]
Ayo, and we can flip shit and rip it with yo' name
Cause on the way to Auschwitz there was no dancing on Soul Train
[Fresco]
Eh, Dan said he piped a Mexican broad but I don't think so
Cause you speak Spanish so you realize that no means no
But to your wife, yes means yes and no means rape
And maybe means I'm giving her a protein shake
[Round 4: Dirtbag Dan]
You know what? Honestly, you guys keep fucking around and it's the world's end
I'ma hold your ass down while Soul Khan beats the fuck outta your girlfriend
[Soul Khan]
If I slap Fresco he'd release a deafening queef
I have to say ""no homo"" after every single sentence you speak
Real Deal murdered you, you continue to nut hug
My papa was a rolling stone, yours is a butt plug
[Dirtbag Dan]
A fucking cross on your yard kid? You must really like me
Go out there, pull it out, and pray to daddy nightly
[Soul Khan]
Yo Real Deal, this might be a sore subject for me to tread on
But I don't think your son is gonna like his new step mom
Y'all some mark ass new jacks, we were born for doing this
If Grind Time was Voltron, Fresco would form the uterus
[Dirtbag Dan]
Yo, he rolls with a squad of broads but never wants to bang out
Cause all the chicks wanna do with dudes is go shopping and hang out
I mean, come clean bro
You kick it with a bunch of teen hoes
Who only really let you hang out cause you let 'em borrow your clean clothes
[Soul Khan]
And Real Deal got a jersey of Roberto Clemente
That's really sweet and fine
But here you gon' be like him and die before you reach your prime"

Achko Machko,Yo Yo Honey Singh,"[00:00:00]
Oh shit, I guess we're starting
The mic is where my heart is
I know what my part is
I hear my own voice
I make my own choice
I guess, we're fuckin' doing it
The horse is out the gates
It's time to start the race
Shoutout to Kathy Bates and also Betty White
All the people, if you're the type
I wanna say that you're equal on the mic
But nobody's equal to me
Nobody is coming for my neck
I am looking for respect
I'm not looking for a check
Unless it is for my friends
That's why we're doing this
To make some pennies
And maybe make amends
Sailors in the sea might get the bends
That is my fuckin' dream
To go with James Cameron in a submarine
To the bottom of the ocean
Rocking forth with the motion
Me and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion
Sharing our emotion
Daring you to fuck with us
At the sea, at a deep water vent
But we don't got the bends, we're not bent
I think that's what I'm meant to do
Me and my crew
Gigantic, looking to cross the sea
For the Titanic
Oh shit, you mean they found it?
Already? They'd abounded with treasure?
Man, that doesn't give me pleasure
I don't know how to measure
How I feel about that shit
But that won't make me quit
In my quest, to scour the deep sea
Like, you and me?
Searching for an angle, mangled
The corpse in the Bermuda Triangle
Maybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane
We're like ""oh, shit, what remains""
And
Then we get to the bottom
Amelia Earhart's like ""oh, shit, got em!""
You didn't know, but I was an immortal
I just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal
Shuffled off my fucking mortal coil
Mortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil
All my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal
And you know, I am not gonna take a foil
To my head in a little tin cap shape
Because you know I'm great
I popped the grape
But I'm not on some conspiracies
I'm just trying to see what's up in the seas
I believe that I will not cease and desist
You cannot resist
When I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist
I am in Manila, in Hong Kong
In San Francisco, doing a disco
Pop it hot like it's Crisco
But I gotta pace myself
If we're gonna raise this wealth
That's why I flow at this tempo
Hello, I do kempo
In my mind, that's a form of martial arts
But I take, partial starts
And I just gave little partial farts
When I'm shitting on the mic
'Cause you know I got this heart
And you know I got the K-Mart
State-of-the-art mind
But I'm not be-hind
No, I'm way out in the front
Rolling up a 30-foot blunt
And you know I'm not gonna bunt
In a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger
Because I am the rap ringer
I never make the wrong call
And you know, chicks dig the long ball!
I am like (Ah)
They are like (Wow)
Watsky, you cannot stop me
I got no paparazzi
I'm a fucking doorstep
I'm gonna take one more step
And then, take another
Word, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'
Here I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada
Just keep rappin', yada yada yada
Hey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld
Me and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld
Or maybe it's more like Larry David
Because you know we're not playing
Shoutout to the Jews, the chosen people
You know that you cannot fuckin' lose
But also, shoutout to the Christians
Shoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions
You know you cannot stop it
Also, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith
Who know we're gonna make way
For the Jehovah's Witnesses
They got their hit list-esses
Walking up to the different fuckin' doors
Saying ""Would you like to love God a little more?""
But it kinda sucks, just because of COVID
They can't be making no bids
I heard they're not doing that door-knockin'
But, you know, we're not stoppin'
However you appraise 'em
No, we are fuckin' raising
On the mic I'm fuckin' blazing
If the sun is blazing
I turn into a raisin
I'm bringing this whole craze
For almost two whole days
I don't think that's possible
I don't think that's wise
I don't think that's probable
That is what they say when they look in to my eyes
My momma was afraid for me
She busted in like the maître d
She said ""Hello umm""
I don't think you wanna sit here
I don't think you wanna get here
'Cause you might die
You know but then I was like ""I gotta try""
I gotta try to do the right thing
Shoutout to Spike Lee
I'm gonna try to get the ring
Try to get the bling
Try to be the king of the long raps
Like I was the dude with the ass raps
Doesn't matter
As long as the people fuckin' clap
As long as we give a little joy
Give em dat'
Then I will cut the crap
I guess I am a believer
And I don't care that I got seizures
I got my fuckin' pills
I'm gonna take 'em right around midnight
So I can get right
I think that's what I gotta do
Shout out to the medical commun-
Itty I just get gritty
I hope my rhymes are not shitty
Umm, mic check are you with me?
Shout-out Bobby and Whitney
But not shout out to the bad things he did
I don't know if I'm gonna have a kid
I don't know if I'm gonna raise a child
But it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild
They would make be fuckin' smile
They got fuckin' bile and some guts
Everybody does
Everybody got guts
Everybody got nuts
Or half the people maybe like 48.7%
That's about how it went
I think that is the percentage-ish
Of the gender fuckin' separation
Although we know in this nation
Things are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient
If you don't understand
I got my fuckin' rhymes on demand
I can run it back
But I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness
If I'm trying to fuckin' win this
I will not get winded, I have not rescinded
Anything that I've fucking said
By the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead
I'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds
That is like Right Said Fred
You just gotta relax
If you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe
I don't get lyrical cataracts
So I can see clearly, so I can be dearly
Received, I've got to achieve
Whatever I've got up my sleeve
Whatever I've got in my pouch
Shoutout to pouch, ouch
I pricked my finger, that is not true
But on this mic I will linger for you
And for my crew
This is what I've got to do
I've got to drop it hot for you
'Cause this is why I'm hot
This is why I'm not
Shoutout to Mims
Shoutout to Hims
That's that brand of underwear
That I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway
I'm drivin' down the one way
I'm cruisin' up the runway
Spreading my wings
Like I am a Cessna
Like I am a chestnut
Roastin' on an open fire, bing!
Crosby, you got me
Me, hot see?
Me Watsky
See?
Sittin' in the hot seat
No, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat
But that word, beats droppin' me
And meha coppin'
Shoutout to Frank Macoppin
Playground
In the fuckin' San Francisco SFC
Because you know how this go
We are the best in Dolores Park
We have a chorus singin' in the dark
Hark, the angel
Shoutout to Chuck Rangel
Rangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but
In December maybe I will be dismembered
By a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa
Comin' down my chimney
Wavin' fuckin' butcher knives
That’d be fucking crazy
Who is he
Who is this robotic crazy Santa
Oh my ‘lanta
I can’t believe that he’s tryna get me
Instead of giving me presents
I can't believe that he got me on the ground
But I'm like ""no I'm Watsky""
And Santa said ""oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude""
But I'm like ""that's rude
Santa you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'
Plus I was in the nude
He got me tackled on the ground
My fuckin' whole brood around me
And I got my whole butt out
He's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away
Cut-out
Cut it out like on Full House
John Stamos
John Stains-Most in his pants
But that's okay
We don't judge people who like to dance away the day
If they need a Pepto-Bismol
My throat is not abysmal
This all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt
I will not repent
And I’m not demented
But I meant it
When I sent it
From my brain
I'm not plain
Im not fuckin' around
I’m not cluckin' the ground
Just right there it’s only two feet
That’s pretty cool man I eat
From that cup right there
The one that’s floatin' up in the air
It’s got a fuckin' strawber-
-ry smoothie
I flow very smoothly
But you cannot do me
Do me, do me like that
I got that roomie type rap
It’s mad philosophical
I just keep on droppin' all
Of the marbles in my brain
They’re comin' out my nose
And then they just remain
On the ground
Even the cat’s eye
That is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by
Did you know at places
People on the internet watch marble races
I watched one
It was mad fun
I picked the fuckin' blue marble
And my pick wasn't all garbled
It came down the shoot
It was going all fuckin' cool
And then it fuckin scooted past the red one
That kid from The Shining like Red-Rum
Meaning murder
Worder
Wordier
All my flows are so dirtier
Than you could even fuckin' guess
I'm not even fucking stressed
I'm so damn relaxy
Shout out to a Maxi-Pad
For being so absorbent
That's a good fuckin' fuction
My girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it
Put her hands in the air
Maxi Pads doing what they do down there
If you are shaved or if you've got hair
It doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare
Do what you wanna
Word to your mama
Your dude can't tell you what you gotta do
Gotta do what you wanna
Make your own choice
With your body or your voice
If you are moist
I know some people don't like that word
Palabra
But you know you gotta like what you like
There was this one time this dude named Ike
Ran to be Prez
And he fuckin' won
Eisenhower, that's what I said
I's a power-rapper
Yes I am
So fuckin' dapper
The clapper
Doesn't work on the lights on this green screen
Man, that would be a dream scene
If I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want
What I want, damn
That would be no scam
I don't eat no Spam
That's 'cause I am a soft boy
And I only eat Bok-Choy
'Cause I'm a little veggie human
And that's what I be doin'
Let me clarify
Like clarified butter
Again, word to your mother
And also not to digress
But I gotta get it off of my chest
Word to Mark Wahlberg
Word to ballers
Wait, okay, let me make my main point
As I rap over this joint
And that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy
I also eat soy
I also as a Jewish type dude not a goy
Get lots of joy out of eatin' carrots
Out of eatin' broccoli
Out of eatin' lots of trees
Out of smokin' lots of trees
That is true
That is not
I don't smoke a lot
But I do when I party
But during COVID, I party hardly
And I guess that's kinda sad
But I've had some calls with my dad
Paul Watsky
And Claire Watsky
It's rare, stop me
It's not, lots of Sundays
I call my parentals
And I just steal out my fuckin' mentals
But I don't pull out my dentals
I go sometimes I do in a dream
When I am on the scene
And the ghost come and make me scream
It's like you are doing the most
And I gotta fuckin' boast
Shout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast
That is some shit if you take a gander
That was said by Mr. Ned Flanders
Mr. Homer Simpson
I'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on
They're like “Watsky, I'll do everything for you
I'll white knight for you and your fucking crew”
I'm like “Dude, don't be a simp
Actually, DO be a simp
You could be pimp
You could be wimp
You could fucking walk with a limp
You can have a crimp in your dimp-le”
I just get the whole tent pole
Up in the sky cause I meant
Lots of people can come in
Cause I got a big tent
So if you are a lame
Fucking get bent
And by lame, what I mean in this game
Is the type of person who says that you're lame
Is the type of person who judges
Is the type of person who never budges
When they get stubborn
Cause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard
[?] 00:18:04
Word!
I think I got this whole thing turn-ed up
But that is bound to happen
34 hours when you keep on rappin'
Some words are going to collide like trains
Coming head to head, but it remains
To be seen that I get back on the track
With the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*
With my fucking clapping gums
So don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb
Sometimes
Cause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes
But it happens and I think that is the lesson
That you cannot achieve perfection
And it's not even a worthy goal
You just gotta try to put that ball in the hole
More times than not
This is why I'm hot, as I said
But, you know Man's Not Hot?
Although the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am
'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham
On the microphone-o oh no
Can't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno
Ice skatin' all over the beat
Makin' it repeat
I do not want to beat my meat, on the camera
That would be a bad fuckin' PR move
When I'm all up in the groove with my meat out
They would be like ""oh, shout out
That will ruin my career
Is that fuckin' clear?
Showin' his whole rear?
He got fuckin' nakey
Make me, take me
You cannot bake me
In my EZ bake oven
No Sara Lee
I just keep on flowing, so merrily
Verily, forsooth, did he do that shit
Oh shit, man he's in the booth dropping it
He's just Frank Coppin it
And there is no halting' it
I just put some fuckin malt in it
Make it like some Yoo-hoo
Yoo-hoo!
Did you fuckin' boo hoo when I rhymed
[00:20:00]
'Cause you could not rhyme
Like I do, do the crime and you know that I'm
Just puttin' lime on top of this shit
And that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me
'Cause you know when I put it on top
That I am going to make it drop
To the bottom of the urinal
You're all in my brain
And I'm hearing y'all
But I'm not 'cause I'm not seeing comments
I be too scared to see the tools
But I got to just remain bold
And I've got to stay in the hold
My whole nuts life, oh, my nuts
Remember that shit? Remember Gobble Guts?
Remember jungle?
[00:20:41]
[00:30:00]
They got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate
Verbally, vocally, stoking the fire
Of the couress I retired
I feel one year
'Cause when my nuts dropped I did not know clear
See how I could sing, that took many years
Before I try to do with the din
And now I only rapped
And now I only try to cap, no cap
I just try to get that back
That back, uh, back
And I'm gone
Over the fence
No shout out to my pens
You know that goth is a dude who's friends with Lynn Maranda
[00:40:00]
I'm sittin' on the veranda
Just sippin' on my water
Lookin' at my ink blotter
Feelin' like the best
Starin' at my Rorschach test
And it's tellin' me some dark crap
It's tellin' some star type of stuff
Like oh shit, I'm gruff
I'm like Scruff, Scruff, Scruff, my gruff
Scruff, my gruff, Chicago, Illinois
6-0-6-5-2 that I'm
(00:44:22)
You know that a bat kills
Using sonar
Going through the cave
With the lights pulsing like it is a rave
I am not a knave
In the sense of my evil
I'm like Evel Knievel
I can jump over three mics
With my tiny little bike
I am gettin' funky
Did you see that video yesterday with the monkey
On the motorbike
That pulled that kid down the street, yeah that little tike
It was really scary
I didn't eat for like three hours, you dared me
To, but I said that that video was too weird
A monkey trying to steal a kid, man, this dude's clear-ly
A weird type of simian
Type of chimpanzee, I don't know which one
It was, it was in Jakarta, I think?
I don't know what type of the rink
Of this world that I skate
I repeat that I'm late
To the party
But that means that partly I gotta go hardy
Hardly, not like Tom Hardy
I don't like smarties[?]
This is a smoothie by the way, I'm hardly
Eating nothing, I say
I say, good sir
Would you like to duel?
I'll trade you a mule
I'll trade you a tool
I'm going to school
Going to university
Facing adversity
You're seein' the worst in me
I am not burstin' the
Seams, like memes
I'm eating ice creams
I'm chasing my dreams
I'm just tryna seem like a normal dude
But I'm not chilly like Hormal, rude
I am in the can
You know it is not a stamp
What we're doing is real, no fake news
I cannot make you
I cannot take you
Being so far away
I just plant the seed like a caraway
Like a fucking sesame
I want to give you more besame's
More besame
You though?
Besame mucho, when this is all over
(00:46:52)
(00:48:16)
Space Jam 2, fucking Pawnstars
(00:48:19)
What do you feel
[00:50:00]
Man, will it get real?
(00:50:53)
Squidward you had one job
Flipping them burger patties
Rollin' those damn fatties
I wonder what you think
If you try to blink
Man you can just imagine
That you were underground with an fat one
I mean under the ocean rollin' up
Tryin' to light a blunt in the ocean
I don't think that it would light, what emotion
Do you think if you think of Spongebob
Rollin' up under the ground in a pineapple
Under the sea, that is quite snapple [?] of me
To tell you exactly, you see?
I smell you, I feel you, E-40
Would say that to me if it was not so portly
If he was not better
Oh shit, I accidentally insulted E-40
And I was not on purpose
Lord, forgive me, I did not mean this to do this
It just came out of my mouth then it felt the rudest
Even though he's a hero compared to Ham Amazero
I am like Chalamet to De Niro
Dinero, oh shit, shout out to the kid Nero
And Deezus, they are like verbally Jesus
With lots of great writing, Josh fuckin' Gondol, man
Writing that shit, man, you know he's beyond the man
Remember that movie Joanna, man?
I don't think that it was very good
I think that it was sorta weak
But you know that a type of wood is cherry or tea
And yes, I can speak, I'm a freak
Of the week and my beak
Just keeps flappin' and I keep rappin'
I wonder when the beat change will happen
What I keep snappin'
My fingers, I linger
I bring her a pain
I bring this game
To a whole new level
I use a tool like a bevel
Holla without, I am not a devil
I am not a bowl evil
Shout out to all people
All creative people
But not all have the same struggle
You know life's a thugga
War, some people got more
And that is the weird shit
The way that we're living
We don't wanna give in
To the system we were born in
And I hate to horn in
With my own damn opinions
But I don't think rackin' pinions
Steering is the best, man, I'm clearin' out my chest
Now I gotta give you what I think
I don't think you should wear mink
But I think everybody should wear pink
I think everybody should stay hydrated and take a drink
I think that fucking Joel Santana
Cameron were ahead of their time
Damn, thinking purple
Six ones so I can have big fun
I'm gonna ball on the wall
With the lights pulsing like it is a rave
I am not a knave
I'm a fan
And you all know
And you all go at your own damn speed
It's kinda odd
That I'm flowing the dude who loves all this poetery
Not odd
But his name is girad
Whatever he has I'm sure it's a great bod
And up on the scene in between
I wanna shout out sierra steen
And be so adroit
To remember to shout out alex niece from detroit
A type of weed is harissa or is that a type of spice
Either way I wanna shout out Alyssa and she's really nice
Coughs
Shit I grab this water
I keep on flowin hotter
Hide your wives and your daughters
That’s an og meme man
Inkblotter
I can say a whole mouthful
And that’s me
And I gotta give a shout out to ali
And I'm like goddamn
I give a shoul out to autograph man
And like I gave a shout out to
I just wanna amble
Over to there I don't take a gamble
These are the rarest rhymes I ever spit
This is the rarest three I ever hit
From the middle of the court
Driving down the court in jorts
Oh shit, don't tell Guinness
[1:31:01]
'Cause I really wanna win-ness
And I really wanna go the distance
All the way to the finish
Shout out to Norwegians and the Finnish
Shout out to dudes who are skittish
And also fucking prudish
I just have a new dish
That I eat everyday for my supper
Shout out to [?]
I'm like a guppy
Swimming around in his tank
Not a puppy
You cannot stop me
But you see that Watsky has got what it takes
To not pump the brakes
He is not gonna ever
Sever the ties that he's got
He's no Severus Snape
The cleverest ape on the mic
And you know that he likes
And you know that he loves
To do what he can
He's no toucan sam
He leads with his nose but he gives no damn
And he is goin' ham
He has got the slam
Weed, I see that
Fuckin' Jeff has got the vinyls
'Cause I was runnin' out of shit to this, say
Time to get some things to feed my brain
Now he's got the fuckin' vinyls and they will remain on the table
I think I have got to take a little piss break
Shout out to Mugatu from Zoolander
The hammer falls more American [?]
I am not needy
My mind's not the bearest
Evangeline, Amy Loo Harris
I'm just stayin' alive
Like The Beatles in '65
If I had all the squares I'd hit bingo
John Paul George and Ringo
England's new phenomenal
Pop group, The Beatles, alley oop
Oh shit, like I said
Tchaikovsky and Watsky, I am at the door
Shoutin' out Symphony Number 9 in E Minor
Open 64
I just do my thing, I just am the shit
Shout out to John Chenner's greatest tits
How do you say his name? I don't really know
I'm just tryin' to grow a little more every day
Great tunes, great flows, no rooms
You know I'm ruthless
This is the family library of great music
I keep flowin'
In part because I am inspired by Beethoven
Hello, Nash
That's what Jeff says, man, I got no [?]
That would be bad, man, I'd fall
Just scratchin' myself, man, but now I stall
I'm talkin' no jive
Just shoutin' out Pablo live
Mary Loo Williams
Take care of yourself
Just do it if you can
Watching is enough
You can just click share o
For how an artist
I'm gonna be frank
I'm not a big fan of hank
A little weirded out
And I really love the
You can leave it there
A taxidermied Iguana XD
This is the coolest gift that I have ever gotten
Now I'm just walking as you hear me talking
Hour Two (1:00:00-1:59:59)
If I was on Facebook then I would poke
Every single one of you, but it's nothing romantic
Shout out to Pacific, to Atlantic
And even the Baltic and the Mediterranean
And I am just an alien
When I'm makin' these rhymes
And I'm feelin' so fine
But it is no crime
And I don't get slime
New beat, turn it up a bit
Let me hear it, I'm just fuckin' with it
And I know that now up on this beat
Max Miller Lauren makin' you move your feet
Got the people buzzin'
Max is my first cousin
Wasn't he in Invisible Inc?
He was, oh, that makes you think
Take a little drink
My other glass clink
I cannot blink
Shout out to Link
From Zelda, Melda
Whole lot of people together held ya
In your arms like the Ocarina
Waka Flocka Flame Ocarina
Ballerina aminda
Keep on going, keep on giving
Keep on living, keep on thriving
On this mic I am surviving
Actually, maybe turn it down at here
'Cause you know I care but
If I rap too loud
I think my voice will go horse
I think my voice will go donkey
I think my voice will go mule
I was just rappin' 'bout high rule
That was the dual wear fuckin' link live that
I just got these big raps
A tiger is a big cat
But I don't give a big crap
Oh shit, he really get that
I don't go tip for tap
I don't hold the grudge
I just keep on droppin', I'm like Harren Judge
He is on the yankees
And I gotta say this frankly
I really miss baseball
And mix all the troubles melt away
But we don't have it on Saturdays
Or Sundays or Mondays or Wednesdays or Tues'
But we just pay our dues
Keep on rockin', keep on rappin' for our crews
Keep on doin' what we can for our friends
'Cause they're gonna be the ones in the end
To hold our hand when everything else melts away
When it all goes dark
You gotta all go back to the people from the ones that you knew at the start
I got a lot of great beats comin'
Goin' and drummin'
From my folks
Crackin' like some yokes
You know that I hope
We're gonna heat, go and drop in this dope
And I never will mope
Evermore like the battle
Forever more Led Zep
Shout out to my dude Shep
He's a real hep cat
Do you fuckin' get that?
He was the best that I ever knew
The best that I ever saw
I'm just droppin' bust, all type rhymes
'Cause you know I gotta do this like I'm
A circular saw when I'm wearin' my Birkin stocks
Used to be that I'd work a lot
Now we work a lot tryna get our tour set up
Again 'cause you know that we got these friends
That are promoters in conserve and you owners
And even the fuckin' stage hens
That y'all make it happen
They gon' make it go
They on, make the gear spin
We're winning together as one
Did you think that this could happen?
Oh shit, I got some fuckin' shoutouts
That I get to really say
But we don't really play
No, we don't do that today
Okay, ouch, ouch, it's the shoutouts
That I gotta give to the Beatrice Teer
So everybody knows that if you wanna go
Get a shoutout, is this too on the nose?
You gotta go to watskyrelief dot com
Where you can drop those financial bombs
Pay us some owns, pays us some respects
And at the ten dollar level you get what's next
That is for meet up, say your name on the stream
[1:42:40] start
Never flippin' the bird
Never droppin' a turd
Never gettin' so scurred
That my vision is blurred
Just to keep goin
Just to keep hoping
Just to keep ropin
All of these cattle
Doing this battle
Good against evil
Never gonna leave
Never gonna be
A dude named Steve
I'm never gonna change the name
I'm gonna change the game
You think you can stop me but you can't
I'm outta control like an ant
Hour Three (2:00:00-2:59:59)
I wonder, I've got this doubt
To my girlfriend I'll shout
Amber, do you think I'm saying ""fuck"" too much on the stream? I'm saying ""fuckin'"" a lot
Did that make 'em scream?
That's cool, say it fuckin' more
Oh curl, oh curl, like Cardi B
I put glow hardly into this dark night, man, I'm saying
Fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, man, I'm sprayin'
Man, over this concrete
On this fucking dope beat
Oh shit, this is ham
Pin me in, this is the one I begin
To flow easily
This flow is so easy, see
No Eazy-E
You are all pleasing me
It's no
[2:13:08] start
Is the place that I rap
My throat sounds like I got strap
I got a limp in my step
But I don't ever dip
And I don't wear a slip
I gotta keep it up at the same clip
I woke up with a headache
But I still felt pretty relaxed
I knew in a couple hours
[2:16:00] start
Because he was pouring sweat
A whole bunch of pictures
People thought he looked really bad
Looked really sweaty
They didn't elect him
Because he had
A real bad demeanor
And betweener
All of us
That's just politucs
What do we got next?
What's a history lesson in which the people can be blessed?
Looks like a big battleship
I'm not rattled if
That's what you think
I hope you don't blink
I don't know what this is all about
A hairdresser, man, I'm callin' out
And we're the confessor
All upon my dresser
I will not pester you
And I will not tester
There's some boobies in this pic
That's cool, free the nipple, man, that's real slick
Honestly, the male nipple and the female nipple
I don't really get the difference, man, is it that simple?
Why is one obscene?
Why is one unclean?
I guess that's just what we could talk to think
That stinks
This is a dude clean, fucking clear net
I wonder who is it yet
He's in Paris
That's very romantic
They're across the Atlantic
Oh shit, this is the grassy knoll
That's the picture that I hold
That's the day JFK got popped
In its open top car he was shot
When he rolled up in Dallas
And a shooter on the hill has such malice
And he shot him and he died
That was really sad, I know my mom cried
She was in shock 'cause a little child
Man, for the whole nation that must've been wild
And there's RFK
No wait, that's wrong
You know I don't play, that's his son
RFK is here
Kennedy's son is here, man, saluting near to his father
This is the Pope
I think that's right
Gettin' harder, it's dope
Oh that's wrong, it's Irish play ride John OKC
Get all these facts right, man, you can't make me
Being wrong, that's my emo
On this mic I just spit more emo
Will I stop? I just say heck no
Yeah, here is the Pope
I guess that's just the coincidence he was on the next page, that's dope
I'm not at the end of my rope
At my rope I'm at the beginning
On the path to winning
Here's the cover about Uranus
Here's a dude swinging his kids
Around with his arms
I think that's good parenting
I think you gotta let kids do their own harm
And make their own mistakes
Man, you can't treat them a kid, glubs
That would not be great
Not at my best
But that's cool off my chest
Off my mind, can't expect to be perfect
Who just gotta keep it
Moon event, you gotta have, make it
Go, you gotta take it so slow
If you're gonna cross the finish line
If you're gonna get in time
Oh shit, it's the Fab 4
Yeah, The Beatles, that's more incredible
Than you could believe
Look at John Lennon with his crazy fuckin' sleeves
His military shirt, is that Audrey Hepburn?
I think that is, man, I'm no half stepper
What I think that was, the jacket from that campaign
You can't tell me that that's lame
So iconic
Wow, it's demonic
Harry Belafonte? That's incredible
Man, practically edible
Damn, I don't know
Woodstock, should be Hetrix
Who knows? You could blow
Wow, there's a lot of top list stuff in this book
I think that's great, man, that's not rough, look
I would show you if I wouldn't get flagged by YouTube
I'm on my sauce like shoyu, so sauce and you know that
This looks like million
A heart, I could heal one
[2:46:04] start
I have just begun
And I have not yet won
I have not yet stopped
I have not yet ceased
And I am not creased
I am not diseased
I am not leavin'
I have no bee sting on my head
I am just beasting until I'm dead
I make them see red
I have not been bled
Thank you [to person off screen]
Of all my hope
You know I just go and vote with my mind
I also vote absentee
Yeah, actually
I'm still a voter in the San Francisco 415
Prolly will be 'til the day I die
'Cause my mom is up on local politics
You know I gotta want it
You know I gotta put it straight
I got this bee in my bonnet
Me? I am not going to just stop
And drop
And stop-drop-and-roll
That’s what they teach you to do
When you’re on fire to hold
I’m on fire, I’m old
I break the fuckin’ mold
I only spit gold
I only spit cold
Again, I have not been Rick Rolled
Let’s see what the scrabble dictionary got
I hope it’s got some words that’re hot
To put up in my pot
So I can stir them 'til I'm not
Dead
This word is Amboli
I don't know what that means, but it rhymes with holy
No power
For this word that says embower
A lot of these words
I won't know
Because I'm not that smart man, yo
This next word is jackal
I have got such sack, I'll
Keep on goin'
The next word is jacket
They wonder, can I hack it?
They wonder, can I do it?
Will the flow stay under so fluid?
This next word is jade
I do not get paid from this stream
I just got to scream
I just got to seem
Like I'm not a jaguar
I'm not quite a rap star
But I'm famous in my own mind
I am feelin' so fine
The next word is Jakes
I've got what it takes
The next word is jaundice
I didn't know that was on list
The next word is Job Owner
Uh, okay homer
Um, okay boomer
I think I am doomed, or
Something like that
But my rap has to keep goin'
It cannot stop for a moment
The next word is jeep
All these fuckin' words, man
I toss 'em in a heap
I'm not allowed to sleep
I would not make a peep
If the sandman came and sprinkled sand dust
In my eye
I would be like
""What the fuck, guy?""
Why'd you sprinkle sleep dust in my eye
That is going to make me stay awake
Man, I try
To go to sleep but this
Goddamn jackass sprinkling sleep dust in my face, man
That is really messed up
It’s the whackest
That does not make me feel jolly
I like Buddy Holly
From Weezer AND the dude
I hope that's not rude
I hope you been brewed
Houston, where they're chopped and screwed
Houston, do we have a problem?
Am I on one?
Man, I'm not gonna go 'til I drop
The next word is judicare and judicial and judo
Shout out to my dude Budo
From Seattle
Kickin' this battle

The next word is jungly
My own ambitions punish me
Next word is junkey
Some days I feel spunky
Some days a feel funky
I'm just a weird monkey
The next word is jubon
Did you buy this book with a coupon?
Did you get your gray poupon?
I'm not somethin' to poop on
So if a pigeon flies up to me outside
I be like ""Man, your wings are how wide?""
And be like ""Aw, not as wide as a condor.""
But if you like me, you can take a gander
Out in gondor with the rings
Where they have the legend and the three kings
Man, I'm still beasting
The next word is kaiser
I am releasing all of my tension
I cannot mention
The next word is Kame
And Kamela, and Kain
The next word is Kanji
Did y'all see Jumanji?
I only saw the first one
I don't know if the next one was the worst one
The next word is Kappa
Y'all remember PaRappa the Rapper?
Dude was cool, he had a beanie kinda like mine
And he had some tight rhymes
Was he a dog or a rat?
I don't remember what animal that dude had
In his genome
Y'all wanna see me home
I just keep goin' and goin' and goin'
Don't quit it
I just hit it this rhythm
And tried to get wid, umm
I cannot sit, umm
Never gonna stand up
Man, I put my hand up
The next word in here is kept
To my feet I haven't leapt
But I am not stressed
The next word is keypad
Y'all can't see me mad
Y'all can't see me bad
Next word is key

I sink it in like the teeth when I'm gettin' the slim
Lead like I am tiger on the green
From the T to the green, man, I'm in
And everywhere in between
I barely hit the fair way
But I can parlay what I need to
'Cause it's not related
When I rack these beats I'm see-through
And my intentions
Did I mention? That were trying to go
For so god... long
That we'll sing a song
That cannot be wrong
I'm here just to rock

[07:34:51] end
Hour Eleven [10:00:00-10:59:59]
[10:45:30] start
As I roll by
I see the clouds in the sky
Feeling so fly
I am a whole guy
So please hold my beer
As I do something dumb
I be gone to come
This is my [?] drum
My life is not home drum
I think that is pretty damn exciting
I really love writing
I really love Henning
Flows, shout out to my dude Henning
He's my german promoter
And I think he's doper
Than any other German
Promoter I've ever had
Even though he's the only one, man, I'm not mad
Okay, a couple sips of water
I'm getting hotter, not in the bad way
Just gotta put that away
I could keep on flowing 'til Saturday
I could put the hat away
*Nah, I won't do that*
I could battle my demons and get vertigo
Hope I'm not hurting, yo
Since itself in your mind
But leave that behind
Everything is integral
In life, because I'm pimpin' all
Avenues like I'm the Scarlet Pimpernel
You know that this is swell
I italicize for emphasis
Gettin this, thankyou for these words you spit and put it to my hat because you’re the shit
What we got next here, what are we going to do next here
This next one is diligent
I am not militant
My energy is not really spent
I feel so elegant
My energy's not really spent yet
I got some more in the tank
Fish name is Hank
Feeling fine like candy
Remember when Mandy Moore did her version on that song?
Sure, I don't know, yo, pass the bong
I'm alluring
I am luring a fish straight of its mooring
You wish that you were on the dock
But I clock all of your protests
But I am not going to go test you
Everything I do is not grotesque
You take a mis-cue, cause you know that I miss you
Silicon Valley is where my alley is
San Francisco, but like the tech biz
What the heck is this, all this shiz?
All the companies, non-profitable
But is there really a fucking future here?
I don't man, it's not quite clear
But I'll steer clear of investing in the next best thing
'Cause my money will go out my pockets like rockets
Fly out with a quickness
My fitness is wild
Man, check out my style, my smile
Oh my God -- his dimples -- it's great!
It's the best person ever
Do I sound like Donald Trump yet? Wait
An eternity to pass before you're burning me
This whole class that I know is fucking your degree
Man, don't give me the third degree
My buttocks are so curve-ery, you could not carve it out
Buttocks was the word they left me, so no doubt
I am nonchalant
I keep on going, I just hit the Bron
Are these words coming from the chat?
Wow, that's so cool, crap
You are the selector
I think I am next, or maybe I'm not
Maybe I was next, and now I am the past next
I no flex, it's a surprise coming up blind to your eyes
Shout out to Cool Guys
Shout out to the dual I have arranged with you
In the next morning, meet with your whole crew
10 paces, then turn, then burn our eyes
We smolder as we get older
The bullet travels, it unravels
The space time continuum
It’s like the Matrix, I'm bending over, man
I'm done
Why did I get into this duel with a random fan idk man i got know idea
I'm going ham
I'm on the doorstep of time
I feel your cold fingers on mine
Oh shit that was the grinch
Oh shit, did I flinch?
I have no wish list but to
Inch myself away from death
You know that I got no fucking stress
I'm a replica of myself
I'm just catsing for my help
Feeling like Reptar
Feeling like a rap star
Know when I can rap bars
As I fucking rep hard
Rep hard for the Bay
For the city I gotta save
It's the 415
You come from there, you thrive
And you're feeling alive
But I can't drive up there 'cause I'm stuck here
But I love LA it's been my city for 10 years
I just know where my roots grow
Shout out to Juno
And the planet Pluto
And my boy Budo
And the dude Buddha
You know you could follow him if you really wanna
Maybe even reach nirvana
Reach nirvana with your momma
I don't know
Comma
Like a flow
I don't have much of a beard
This much is quite clear
But I got a couple hairs on my chin
And that's all I really need to win
And I got this little funky soul patch
If I cut it off, will it grow back?
Yeah, probably, but not more
I think I got more on my cheeks
I've grown them for weeks but its uneven
I've got more on one side, it reeks
It sucks more on my left
It’s uneven hair, man, I’m distressed
But that’s okay
Our flaws is what makes us who we are
They’re what make me a superstar
In my own mind, Vaseline
I’m on the scene, I am a queen
Feeling erratic
Give me no static
Shout out to your granny
I wonder if your granny won a grammy
If so, could she hand me that grammy?
I fucking think so
I fucking pimp the mic and I reload
I just take a heat load
Like I am in the oven
Covered in stuffing
I'm like why didn't you put the stuffing inside?
I don't know, it's not for me to decide
They don't let me cook at Thanksgiving
They don't want my gross vegetarian givings
Maybe someone will eat one serving
But nobody wants them, man
It's hurting my soul
One time I made soup
It was dope and swole
One time I made risotto, oh no
I quintoupled the fucking recipe
But no one wanted my cooking, it was the best of me
That's sad
Anyway, we'll go to sleep now
You know I cannot fucking sleep now
I be how I be always, understand
That in these hallways of my mind
My mind is so rubbery
My girlfriend said cover me
And you can discover me
Do you know about topiary
I am so necessary
I cut it like a fancy shrub
Fucking welcome to the club
Gotta give you a clue
You know what I can do
I'm gonna burn it eternal
My cat’s name was Nermal
No, no wait that was Garfield
I'm out in a far field
My mind's feeling far-fetched
You know I have not quit yet
Now I'm feeling vapid
I'm not flowing rapid
You know I just can't hit this joint
And then spit it candid
Or spit in treaties like Candide [?]
I'm on a horse, this man-steed is so dope
That I got my voice, and I know that I got my choice
And it's stupendous
Tremendous flow, when I bend this dough
For the needs of my friends and the needs of y'all
I just get this all of my chest
My chest is throbbing like Batman and Robin
But I will not be robbing
I will not be lobbing softballs all over the plate
If I ever get to interview a politician - wait
I'm looking for a loophole
I'm just trying [?]
Get it, too swole
Scolded, scalded, man, you know
Gotta keep it simple
On a lake as I ripple
Feeling my nipple
Flowing to the tempo
Never let this end, no
I'm a real rice bloke
I will not choke
I don't do coke
Well, I did a couple times
I didn't like it
I thought I kinda had to try it
But it wasn't for me and I stopped
Two times - three times? Man, I dropped
Some acid, though, out in Venice
At the Biennale with my dentist
That was fucking cool, man
That was better than some school, man
I furrow my brow vexingly
No witches are hexxing me
I do it to the nth degree
I do it so specially
Cardiac is my speciality
You got no space balls
I could just make all
Of your dreams come true
Give you a harpoon
And a damn balloon
To pop I'm in the navigator
With an alligator
They say ""See you later""
They say ""Meet me later at the pie spot""
Grab some pie and some coffee
All these people get off me
It’s just me, Watsky
But you know that I'm not gonna be pulled
To your dimensions and ambitions
Did I mention that occasionally I get anxiety?
I have no real piety
I don’t know why it’s me in this body, but it is
So I try to be
An okay type of dude in my daily life
In my daily doings, and maybe I
Succeed from time to time and
Do good from rhyme to rhyme
But I am keenly aware that when you see me, you stare
'Cause you're like ""He looks like some dude who might make me cum
Just by looking."" Oh, are you booking me with your eyes?
Are you cucking me? Why are you doing that?
You could rap about yourself in a strange day
Maybe you do every damn day
If so, you should send me the link
And when I’m not rapping for 33 hours straight
I think I’d try to watch you
If you sneeze, I would say “Achoo”
If you fucking fall, I gotchu
I try to get you up with my trust fall
I try to fucking say “Fuck all my doubts
All the dark thoughts”
I try to danish those harlots
I’m out at a used car lot
Singing some dope harmonics
SInging some harmonies
The devil can't be harming me
I got this great fantasy
That I'm on the faculty at my old school
But the school is in high rule
I’m not quite squeamish
I’m just on the scene, shit
Munching and munching
On this flow, I just jump in
All my hair is really bunchin’
And I’m eating my luncheon
Snap back on this velcro
They all say say ""Hell no""
I all say “Elmo:
But I know my elbow is really close
But you still can't bite it
That's a Russian proverb
You know I won't hide it
I won't hide it on my timeline
You know that I'm fine
I'm not dying on the vine
But I need to remind you
To rewind this like the time lapse
I might collapse
I might collate myself into notes
And then go late into that deep dark night
But not gently, man, I won't go
They meant me to go so fiercely
You know you can't pierce me
With your arrows and your slings
You know you can't bring me down
When you see this crown, I will not be drowned
Do it all for pocket change
Do it all and remain
I see some words from the chat
Thank you, man, I heard that
I think I'll get - woah, these are lots of words --
Maybe not, you know that you make me hot
Under the collar, holler for a dollar
Was that Honey Boo Boo? I don't know
You do the math
Who do you think you are?
I came so far
Words from the chat: cucumber
Up my butt, that makes me not slumber
Rip me in half, that would make me laugh
I am not better than John Cena
I no go bigger -- Cena, Mena
Pause, makes me pause, I can’t get ya
I am the supreme, dream team
You know that I mean on the scene
Play a small violin, hell no
I play a small cello
I just grate this cheese
But that was unsubstantiated
I don't know if I did or not
Shout out to Itero [?]
Shout out ot Jonah Hill
I'm like ""Yo it's real""
I won't ostracize anyone with weird eyes
Fucking Asian [?] orange, what rhymes with orange?
You know what rhymes with orange? George
Kind of, it's a slant rhyme
But I gotta dance, I'm happy
What’s hydrophobic? Afraid of water?
You know you go quick into dissing me
Are you saying that water on my lips has been missing me?
Sticking me in the back with these kind of sideways disses
I don't know, man
Water gets kisses from my lips
I'll fucking kiss this straw, and I get this raw
When I get this H2O, me and my duo - partner
Start your car, but you know I'm not a starter
I am not harder than whatever's inside your Larter
You got some hard tack, our crack at this is you know
Rio with the hard pack [?]
Fucking Mazel Tov
I could knock your nozzle off
Like matzo ball soup
I'm just saying ""Whoop whoop!""
Shout out to Deadpool
I think it really rules
I'm ridonkuous
I drive a Tonka truck
In an increment, it's like sink or swim
I am not a fisherman
But then I just begin
I'm really wildin' all over the place
I need a Tylenol
This is drastic
What the fuck is endoplasmic?
Oof, gotta boof my strawberry smoothie
Up my damn coof
I don't know -- for a booboo hole
What could be that rhymes with coof
Stick in the opposite of my body’s roof
That was rude
Oh shit, man, damnnit
He just wove a damn vocal tapestry
Just clappin' the mic
And do it so laughably
You know I stay on ya
My words in layers like some lasagna
I'm no Flanagan
Irishman doing damn shenanigans
Actually, man, I'm like quarter Irish
On my mom's side, but I just get Eilish
Billie Eilish on the mic, really stylish
Man, I'm batting my eyelids
I play the etude, no attitude
And then I play the prelude
Out of order, I make my own rules
Got a camcorder, it's so cool
I play that mandala
But you know I swallow all of my pride
Popeye is all in my eye
In my grill, eating his goddamn spinach
Why you like that shit so much man, what is this?
I am hella bae
Hella bae'd out, as clear as cellophane
What the hell remains after that shit out on Anza [?]
Aguirre, a whole damn bonanza
Hear me, I live out on Cabrillo [?]
I scrub like a brillo pad
It's the texture of my hair
And my next flow is recipe
Y'all really got the best of me
All the quality ingredients
You know that you see me slip
I’m like a bonsai tree. I grow so slow
That I’m on my back, I barely move
When I flow, I am like a kind of lizard
Maybe, I don’t know, which kind -
A baby fucking kimodo?
Do they go slow or do they go real fast?
Ask someone else, I don’t know, I fucking pass
I’m so fucking pure
All my references are so fucking obscure
They're like, ""Damn, you suck more than a fucking vacuum""
That's not true, I fucking thank you
For reminding me that time is now
To do what I do, I'm quite down
You, though, are out there like Pluto
I don't take caloric readings into account
But I am just prehistoric, on some mesozoic era shit
I am very Land Before Time, man, it’s very quipped
Well equipped, like Littlefoot or Petrie
Man I will not razzle you, I'm not dazzled
I don't embezzle funds from these funds, I won't take a dollar
Not a red cent, I won't holler
Man, fuck this breeze comin' through on my knees
I'm Chuck E. Cheese
I got this piranha flow, I got the jump off. man
So Geronimo!
Man, I'm on the way down
But they can't take my crown
With these verbal ballistics, I need these statistics
The elephant in the squad
Is not relevant, man, that's odd
I just rhyme frequently
And I do it with indecency
But I got respect from all where my peers intersect
But I connect with yo on my goddamn Rolodex
Not in my Rolls Royce
I have just got no choice
I'm a cuck
That's not true, try my luck
That's the first thing that I said when the cuck card popped up
I don't watch my girlfriend fuck others
That would be kind of strange for our relationship, ayeee
Don't wanna play that way
It's okay if you do, but that not my thang thang
I brang brang rhymes and I try to sang sang
Get some more protein, you know that I mean
What I seen, I am not a dinkle leaf [?]
Little type of periwinkle
That was a very poorly constructed rhyme
But you know, fuck, I can find sometimes
I'm behind my mind in my mouth ways
You know I go gray [?]
I just get all in, I am just fallin'
Sometimes I say ""Fuck it,""
I got a little whack nugget of rhymes
And then I put it to the side
And then I just rewind my mind
And get these rhymes so hectic
When the morning becomes eclectic
Shout out to KCRW
Support your local stations, it won't trouble you
Getting so mega
Buying a ham, bacon, cheese at a bodega
I just gotta say I don't know how to play
The next word in the pile
It really makes me spile
But repugnant is not an easy word to rhyme
So I put it at the top of the rhyme and I'm fine
And I'll need some caffeine in a couple hours
When I'm on the damn scene, but for now
I'm fucking good as hell
Unscrewing my mind, man, you can tell
That is coming off like a relief cap that I just had to doff
I hope you don't scoff if I just seem soft
I feel animated, I feel that I made it -- oh shit!
What we got now? Kush Mody, throwing it down
Can I get just a bit more volume?
I am just callin' em
It feels good to fucking flow the Mody beat
Maybe a little more even? Just a fucking smiggen
I am not a stool pigeon -- that's awesome
Shout out to the DJ, replay
Everything you said, man, I'll relay
All inside of my head
Minding my own business until I am fucking dead
Man, remember Kush Mody, out in Boston
We got lost in the sauce and we did it
Man, we knew each other so long
I can’t even believe that we been so strong
And with Jackson out in the winter
We were like Master Splinter
You remember, we were doing it
We were making that music shit
I'm so proud and glad at how far we've come
And how far we had to run
I'm flipping like an acrobat on the beat
Can you fucking handle that? I will repeat this
It's about connectivity
This is nativity
It's like the young Christ giving me strength
I don't think twice, I just go back
I'm a player, but I don't crush a lot
I just wanna hit the beat a lot
I fucking got to repeat you, I'm useful
But you know that I am full
I'm not just reactive
I'm radioactive
But I am that kid
And I take it back quick
The next word is adultery
Fucking plucked like upholstery [?]
The beat keeps on thumpin'
Kush mody on the beat keep on bumpin'
The hour gettin' ungodly
Will I keep on going
Probably
I don't wanna create a fiasco
Just because of my wack flow
I wanna keep on goin'
I wanna keep on rowin'
11:02:50
Shoutout to Kudy Hodge
He does his duty
He’s a god
On the mic
Like supposedly
You know that yo it’s me
I got it in the pocket
I gotta fuckin’ lock it
Down
When I get downtown
No matter what they’re tellin’ me
It’s all about utility
And whatever they be sellin’ me
Shoutout to Bellamy
Yeah mister Bill Bellamy
I’m trying to make the vibe intimate
I’ll be back in a little bit
But I never stop hittin’ it
I’m just trying to pick a bit
This is my distribution
I’m just trying to hit this bullshit
Feelin’ fucking mystical
Like I said
I will hit the wall
I might need a thermometer
If you just have to monitor
How hot my flows are heating up
I’ve got to fucking tell you
I am speeding up
But that shit is not something i can maintain
Because my brain if fucking mush
Records I won’t falsify
I am just calling my
Shots
Everything good in the jood
Great
I just keep on flowing and relate
Shoutout to octopussy
The move movie you can’t push me
It was 007
He was going up to heaven
But that to damn nation
Imm now at my station
Rapping
Me ego
Is to keep flow-
Ing til we go
Go into that cold cold night
Shoutout to Snow White
That was cool
And renknowned
The flow is everlasting
I am always blasting
The beat on the stereo
Oh shit
Watsky
Look man
Here we go
He's rocking the mic
He's not stopping to hike up his jeans
Or his shorts
Or his shirt
He doesn't have time for that
Man he hurts
This mic
Is the only thing that he hurts
That he's not a fucking pacifist
Against and again I ask the mic
If he believes he is just hurt
????
Bu that was something we tried to fucking prove
But I am not a hoodlum
I keep dropping these good
Um
Flows
Some get stuck in my esophagus
Thats where its just stoppin’ it
Feelin’ good tho
A few hours ago
It felt like I might not flow
Like my throat was getting real kinda shitty
But then it got better
Why you stay with me
Feelin’ so witty
Shoutout to my dude Schmitty
And nitty gritty
The DJ
Man, he's probably not with me
But he did a couple dates on the Warped Tour
I just wanna move your
Body
Shoutout to the beatpork
State
2014
We were great
Shoutout to my girl kflay
She's got a verbal aka-47 thousand
Deep inside her chest
She's reknowned
She's great
She's hounding
She's got that rhyme caviar
I say daddy are
You
Willing to take top billing
To fucking build me up and sign cor ranfycking building
Because I am not a homeowner
And that is not great
But don't all our states change with the COVID
Man some people having no kids
Because this changed our whole worlds
No little boys or girls
And maybe wait a bit
Or don't
I don't know
That's your life
Do whatever you want with your time
[11:07:06]
Because our lives are so bountiful
And we gotta just power through
Live and thank ourselves and our lucky stars
Or wonder where the fuck we are
In the universe
This is so true it hurts
But I'm not a salesman
I'm more a drink and an ale man
Bringing the truth like a mailman
Feeling like a maniac
Flowing like a brainiac
Because you know that the way I rap
Is so goddamn loquacious
That I'm saying it's gracious
When I'm on the mic I say shit
But otherwise I might not like to say
But I can’t just put this damn mic away
I'm in my cubby hole
Hiding out
'Cause you know that my buddy's roll
It's a scout
If the teacher is coming
Playin' hide-go-seek and you know that I'm drummin'
On a melody
Tell me
Fucking Makaveli
Do you smell me
You know I get heli-
Coptered out of my own mind
The doctor proctored my test
But you need not remind me
That this life is cyclical
I’m putty in god’s hands man
My buddy
It's fucking paramount
To get a golden parachute
This life is rare amount of time
But you know that we get the shoot
We're gonna lose and dilute
And leave a weird residue
I don't know
Who are you
All of these night critters
Are giving me real jitters
In the morning I won't eat fritters
I'll probably eat more smoothie
I wonder how much more there is
A lot
It doesn't have much fizz
Although at some point I have to drink the redbull-y
And then you will have to pull me
Up
On my ass from the couch
And I don't know if I doubt
Myself
I just drop these lyrical thesis
Theoretical theses
You know I make theses
Flows
I got no place-
Bo
Boop
And it doesn't make me mad
Shout out to Adam, that's the supper of dead
I'm gettin' all in
Shout out to Ben from [?]"

Suno kal raat ki kahaani
Pee li Red Wine maine puraani
Laakh roka tha yaaron ne
Ke na kar tu manmaani (x2)
Mili mujhe ek apsara
Kehndi mere kol aa zara
Mujhko yeh tu bata
Kya tera dil hai lapata
Oye!
Dil chori sadda ho gaya
Oye ki kariye, ki kariye? (x2)
Naino mein kisi ke kho gaya
Oye ki kariye, ki kariye?
O madam teri chaal
Tere silky silky baal
Ab main is se zyada kya kahoon
Main nashe mein talli ho gaya
Oye ki kariye, ki kariye?
Dil chori sadda ho gaya
Oye ki kariye, ki kariye…
Munde kudiya sab ral-mil jaayenge
Hoke crazy jab floor pe aayenge
Saare milke note udayenge
Zoom kar karke video banwayenge
Saare hain yaar saare hain cousin
Let’s celebrate pre-wedding shagan
Dhoondhta hoon main bhi dil woh kanwara
Jiske liye lage dil ki lagan
Kayiyo ke aaj honge rishte pakke
Jinke ho rahe hain nain-matakke
Tu bhi akh seedhi mere utte rakhe
Das ki kariye…
Dil chori sadda ho gaya
Oye ki kariye, ki kariye?
Naino mein kisi ke kho gaya
Oye ki kariye, ki kariye?
O madam teri chaal

Super se oopar maahol banana hai
Bhuaa-Fufad ji ko bhi nachana hai
Poora poora masti pe zor rahega
O pee lo koyi kuch na kahega
Punjabi wedding mein ladkiyan pat’ti hain
Daaru chalti hai khuli bant’ti hai

Birthday Bash,Yo Yo Honey Singh,"There is a place
That is so hard to find
Behind the walls
We build inside our minds
Some break the walls
Some break the rules
Some even get things changed
And when they do
That leads to the truth
Yet questions still remain
But all that it's saying
Somewhere in life
There's a joy to be
Between the hope and reality
There in a mirror
And then the street
That's where you'll find
People in search of a life
And what of love
Is that a point of view
And when you're alone
It can seem so confused
That's when a friend
Can pull you in
Lend you a helping hand
But what happens when
Your only friend
Sells you out in the end
How do you face it
Somewhere in life
There's a joy to be
Between the hope and reality
There in a mirror
And then the street
That's where you'll find
People in search of a life
In search of a life
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Searchin'
Lookin' in a bottle
Lookin' in a needle
Lookin' in the street
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Searchin'

Who got the cocaine
Don't tell me it's
The little kids on Soul Train
The metaphor sent
From my brain to my jaw
It comes from other places
Not the typical places
Journalistic values are yellow
And then the court falters
You watch Channel Zero
And that bitch Barbara Walters
She'll have you believe
Black invented crack
When President Lyndon had to form
A law way back in '63 with Kennedy
Yes, the double-cross
Remember that's when they blew
His fucking head off
Vietnam vets come back lookin'
Like one-armed pets

No picket fence
No job, no ATM in the car

Outdoors in the mud

Stepping all over everything, man

Ahh! I just don't like
Them aeroplane bottles
What the fuck happened?
- Oh, that boy got shot up!

Yo, uh... I wouldn't want you
Not to talk intelligently
The body cold already
Excuse me. Coming through. Thank you
Damn! Excuse me
Hey! Welcome to the show
That never ends
Bartucci, what you got?
We got a black male, dead man
Darryl Adams, 22 years old
He's the night manager of this joint
Kid's standin' by the door having
A conversation with another male
Pop, pop, poppity-pop
Darryl goes down
Shooter does a Carl Lewis
Neighbourhood says
There's four shots fired
At this point, that's all she wrote
- Robbery?
- Nah. Way too fast
Drugs? Was he a scumbag?
To tell you the truth
I never seen this kid before
Boys, Darryl Adams
Darryl Adams, the boys
- Hey, Darryl
- Hello in there
Live by the gun
Die by the gun
- The kid had brains
- Good thing he was wearin' his gold
Bing, bing, bing. Ricochet Rabbit
I still think it was the food here
Hal, get in there
Tell me what you got
There she blows
Let's see
No powder burns on the face
- These eyes have lied
- Looking about 30, 35 years old
- Doors one and two
- OK, let's see
Nothin' up the sleeve
He might get better
But he ain't never gettin' well
- And presto!
- Hey, slapped him five
On the light hand side
Hey, look at that. Looks like some
Kind of an Egyptian peace sign
You're right there. It says goodbye
Hey, Moe. My main man
Gonna need prints off that door
Fuck you, 
Rocco
That'll really narrow it down
We'll get half the yos
In Brooklyn off this door

More prints than my ex-wife

Must be his golf jacket
It's got 18 holes
Oh, Christ!

Come out, come out
Wherever you are
The monkey's on the trolley car
Looks like they did come out
Here's one. Two. Two exits
What's the grapevine say?
What they always say
""We keep our ear to the grindstone.""
- Was he clockin'?

- Hal, how ya doin'?
- How ya doin', Lar
- Check the pockets
- Yeah
Son of a bitch! That's Darryl Adams!
Who?
He worked in Rodney's candy store
I saw him a lot
If he worked for Rodney
He was 
clockin
'
- Hal, check the pockets again
- Sure. Hold on

- What's up, Darryl?
Clockin' like a motherfucker, man
You guys done yet?
Ho! Marvello the magician!

One, two, three
Arrivederci!

One time I was studyin'
To be an accountant
Now this shit is fuckin' my body up
I have a goddam death sentence
That's why I don't
Give a shit about nobody
And I don't wanna
See your ass no more!
Cos you ain't got no business
Out here fuckin' with this shit
You'll end up like me. Or worse
My old man...
Was a preacher
And when I started messin'
With this shit
He said, ""You gonna pay for that
""You gonna pay for that shit, boy.""
He was right
You can't cheat this shit no...mo'
Get the fuck outta here!
Why you wanna be
Always arguin' with me?
No, wait. Listen to me
How many pair sneakers you got?

Long term. See your future

You told me if I wanted
To get off them benches...
Whoa, whoa, whoa
All's I hear is that Ahab's
Lookin' for a new night manager

Look here. You gonna chill

You gonna be on the benches

Strike. What's up with
That train set you got?

You readin' a train book? Choo-choo!
Every man should have a hobby
What's yours? Collectin' welfare?
That shit ain't funny, man. Word up
Why you tryin' to play me, Strike?
I don't talk about them...
Fuck that, man!
I don't talk about them toys
Inside your crib
Yeah, I know, cos I'll
Bust your motherfuckin' ass
Yo, Shorty, what you laughin' at?
- One time says freeze!

Hey, little man. Stay right there
Stand up, mastermind
Hmm. Oh. Is that Rodney?
- Rodney rang?
- You oughtta know

- Yeah, man
Yeah, well, I had to tell
His moms and pops last night
That ain't no joke. I hate it
Rough
I just hope I never have to notify
None of your parents
Leave this shit alone!
How them trains comin'?
Little man, come here. Come here

Uh! Watch out! Oh, man!
Uh! Uh! Flip!

Who did this?
Who did this? Who did this?
Who's tryin' to be my son's daddy
And gave him this haircut?
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Nobody don't know
Nothin' now, huh?
Yo no se nada
I know you. I know you
Cedric Stanley Gilmore
And I know you, too. Ronnie Dunham
Shit
You used to live
Next door to me, remember?
I know your mother. Gloria
You all ain't nothin' but a bunch of
Good-for-nothin', death-dealin' scum
I find out who's been
Messin' with Tyrone
I'm gonna put a bullet
In your butt my own damn self
Don't let me find Andre either
Have a good Sunday
Shit. I know that bitch
Ain't talkin' to me
- Scientific, man, shut up
- You shut up, man
OK, Victor? Ready to go?
Normally I'd cuff you, brother
But you look like
The kind of guy I can trust
Like I said
I had some drinks at Kool Breeze
- Uh, Scotch
- ""Some""?
Like two or three
I usually go in there
After most work nights
Uh-huh. How long were you in there?
Uh, I don't know
About eight-thirty till about ten
Uh, see... My shift...at Hambones -
I'm a...I'm a manager
It don't end till ten
I wasn't feelin' very good
So I left early
You weren't feelin' good
So you went to Kool Breeze?
It wasn't like it was a ""goin' home""
Not feelin' good
You had a headache? An argument?
No, I just...just tired, man
Go ahead
So I left Kool Breeze
Uh, started walkin' home
I cut through Ahab's parking lot
And this guy just flexed on me, man
He jumped outta nowhere
I got scared. You know the rest
Tell me, 
Victor
.
I just... I shot him
Hey, little man
I like that cut
- Where'd you get it?
- Barber shop
You know, you used to have
A good head on your shoulders
Before Rodney got a hold of you
Still do
You know, Ronald, I been lookin' out
For you since you been yea high
Now, you don't want my guidance?
Fine. It's your life
Let me tell you somethin'
You even glance in the direction
Of that little kid Tyrone
And I'm gonna fuck you up so bad
You're gonna wish I had killed you
Now, do we have an understanding?
Do we have an understanding?
Yeah
Why do we keep goin' through this?
I told you already
The guy jumped outta nowhere, I
Got scared... Bam! Then I ran. I ran!
You mean bam, bam, bam, bam
- What?
- Four bullets in the body
- Where did you carry the gun?
- In my gym bag
What else you carry in it?
My uniform from Hambones
A sandwich from home
I don't eat Hambones myself
As quiet as it's kept
OK. Was the, uh
Gym bag zippered, locked?
Don't shake your head, Victor
- Where's my mattresses?
- What?
I told you about my mattresses
For them kids
They ask, ""You say we gonna have
A tumblin' club. We need mattresses.""
And I say, ""Well, Strike's
Buyin' 'em. He promised.""
Now, look, I ain't busted you yet
But till I do
You gonna be my main benefactor
You gonna sponsor this club
You understand me?
And, Ronald, I'm only tellin'
You one more time, you hear?
The store was closed
One of them Jewish holidays
- What Jewish holiday?
- I don't know. Pick one
Tomorrow, all right?
I swear, I'll swing by tomorrow
Andre, these cuffs is too tight, man
You and me used to be tight
Am I under arrest?
What for?
Could you uncuff me, please
And let me outta here?
You don't have to live like this
There's more than just these projects
Out there, you know
Don't you wanna go someplace
You never been?
I mean, you love trains
But you've only ridden the subway
Go on, man. Get outta here
And get them mattresses
For my kids, hear?
- Never
- Never?
You never walked by
On a hot day with your two kids?
- Stopped in for a soda?
- With my two kids?
I barely see my two kids
I'm always working
When I get home, I'm exhausted
Do you have any kids?
Yeah. I have
A two-year-old daughter
Have you ever come home so tired
You hated the sound
Of your own kids cryin'?
Your own flesh and blood
My wife, Sharon, says
""Quit a job. You got two.""
What the hell she thinks I got
Two jobs for in the first place?
Look, I'm...I'm tryin', man
I am really tryin'
To move us out of the projects
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm working, I'm saving
I'm trying to do the best I can
Provide those ends. I gotta work
I'm never late. I gotta work
Victor, listen to me
You're a good, decent
Church-goin', God-fearin' kid
And if you did pull the trigger
There has to be a reasonable answer
Other than what you've told me here
I gotta ask myself, why would Darryl
The night manager at Ahab's
Try to rob you
In his own parking lot?
So I think it had to be personal
Mm-mm. No
I never saw him before in my life
- He flexed, you shot?
- I'm through with it
I told you what happened
What else do you want?
- The truth
- The truth is lookin' at you!
If he did something, if he threatened
Your family, this helps you
You were buggin' - ""can't sleep
Can't eat"". This helps you in court
What did that prick do to you?
It was self-defence
Self-defence, huh?
I wanna see what you see
Uh. I disagree
I don't think I do look
That fuckin' stupid
Dang, man. In the papers
I thought Vic was legit
What happened?
Boy already had like five jobs
Ooh-ooh!
Aw, shit, man! What the fuck
The homo-cide want now?
Mandela projects, all right?
- Yo, Tyrone
- What's up?
Come over here and watch
The car for me, all right?
- All right?
- Yeah, cool. What you gonna give us?
Catch you in a little bit
We ain't gonna do it
For free
I'll take care
Of you later
Excuse me, sir
Which building is 235 Hoyt?
- Right there
- Thank you
Is that Nintendo or Sega?
- Sega
- What's it called?
- ""Gangsta.""
- Whatever happened to Tiddlywinks?
Rocco, don't you know this is
The new sensation across the nation?
- Where you goin'?
- My friend's house
Everybody wants
To be a gangsta, right?
Yeah, you like that, right?
You like lookin' at that, right?
- Wanna know how much it costs
- I know that
Yeah, I'm sure
Probably want to buy one, right?
How you know I don't got one?
- Why did he have that gun?
- Everybody has one
- Does he drink a lot?
- He only drank at night
That makes two of us
- How about drugs?
- He's clean as the Board of Health
Did he have
Any new friends recently?
- Hangin' out with any new people?
- Not that I know of
You must be thinking of Ronald
But he hasn't lived here in a while
- He's quite the athlete
- Yes
- You boys must be proud of your dad
- Yes
I'll bet. Something's not right
When I'm workin' on something
I gotta make it right
These are my two sons
Victor and Ronald
Victor's a hard-working
Handsome young man
He doesn't lie. If he said it was
Self-defence, it was self-defence
Why don't you believe him?
Do you mind
If I borrow these?
I have to go around and retrace
His steps the other night
- and I'd rather not show a mug shot
- Sure
You be good boys
Take care of your mother
- Strike
- You know him?
He's an arrogant piece of shit
Comes into my store all the time
Like he craps beige
He used to work with Rodney
Last year in his store, with Darryl
Now he runs the crew on the benches
Clocks for Rodney just like Darryl
Let's bring him in
- What up, man?
- They went to the ninth floor
Shit! I knew it
- Did they say anything?
- Asked me about ""Gangsta""
- Anything else?
- Nah
All right, Shorty
You did good, man
Go upstairs before your mom
Come down flippin'
All right
Go on upstairs
- Who you hidin' from?
- Come on, man
What you sneakin' up on me for?
I'm not gonna keep tellin' you
To leave him be
- Tell him!
- How you feel about your brother?
It's fucked up, man
I heard he confessed
You been to see him?
I'm goin'. I'm goin'
You need to have your stomach
Checked out
By the way, my kids thank you
From the bottom of their hearts
For their mattresses
Now doesn't that make you feel good?
You know this kid?
- Yep. He was in here
- When?
Boy was in here Friday
He had one drink
- One drink? Wasn't drunk?
- Nope
- He was rude
- Yeah
Ooh! I'm just gettin' warmed up
But it's The Bomb
Was he with anybody?
He came in alone
Might've had a conversation
Can't recollect
Do you recollect the shooting?
Hell, yeah
Who do you think called the cops?
So that's who you're lookin' for?
Do you remember if the kid was here
Before or after the shooting?
He was in here before
You know how I know?
Cos I was watchin' him
I never saw him before. He was jumpy
Thought he might have been
One of those stick-up kids
This is Strike. Jesus Christ
They don't look alike to me
What about him?
Oh, yeah. Victor? A regular
What's up with him?
Strike, how come you didn't tell me
Your brother did it?
Come on, Rodney, man
What, you forgot?
- You told me you didn't wanna know
- Yeah, you right
Victor popped Darryl?
Hey, I don't know if he even did it
Victor your brother
You supposed to know
Errol, Errol, just...
We ain't had that conversation
About Darryl, did we?
What conversation?
There, you see? Ain't no problem
Go ahead, man. Break
That's my boy!
Came in one night only
On the night of the shooting
Has the jumps. Never sat down
Left sober before the shooting
Yo's jacket shows
Possession with intent
Possession of unlicensed firearm
And assault, for which
He still owes three years
Listen to me, Rocco
He's all strung out
Has a few schnorts over his limit
He gets fried, walks out of Kool
Breeze with the heater in his bag
The Adams guy jumps out
Startles him
Pops the first guy
Who steps on his Nikes
It's like a capper on a bad day
That's how these Nubians do it. He
Gets religion, comes in, gives it up
I'm not wasting my time on this
Come on, Larry. Can't you see
What they're tryin' to pull?
Larry. Yo walks in
Says he's the shooter
No record
Two adorable kids, two jobs
Model citizen. Claims self-defence
- OK. All right
- Who's gonna argue?
Now, this other one...Strike
If he tried that, they'd throw
The key away. He's a known scumbag
No wonder this sounds like horseshit
He's lying
Victor never got off that bar stool
- Yo was taken away for his brother
- For what?
Brotherly love?
Fear? For money? What?
They ran a game on me, these two
Cos this cocksucker
Is an innocent man
Just because a Nubian -
Excuse me, Lieutenant -
Got a wife, a job, kids
A dog and a bank account
He can't be a shooter?
You did everything but stick
Your tongue down his throat
The kid didn't budge
Rocco, listen to me
Even if this Victor kid is sellin' us
A line of shit on the tape...
Which is what they all do anyhow
Even if they're givin' it up...
This is still a good
Solid ""closed by arrest""
And if I'm wrong, and Rodney
Conspired in on this, or Strike...
Or the fuckin' Medelln cartel
I don't give a fuck
Cos we got the shooter
We locked up the wrong brother
The wrong brother. Yeah. Yeah
Well, it's on you, OK?
What I want to know is where the fuck
Did these yos get balls big enough
To think that they could
Put this one past me?
I'm tired of hearin' that ""yo"" shit
From you. Back off
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. Excuse me
I don't mean any offence
Anybody can bust off an oowop
What makes Vic any different?
Come on, man
Papers say he had a .38
- Regardless what the papers say
- Wait, motherfucker
When was the last time
You bust off an oowop?
I never murdered nobody
But I'm gonna murder someone now!
Yo, yo, chill. Hold it, man. Kill
That noise. Homo-cide creepin' up
How you doin', fellas?
Look who's here
Ronnie Dunham, big man
- Ronnie?
- Can I talk to you a minute?
Go on, bitch
I'm Rocco Klein
DA's Homicide Squad
- You got a minute?
- Homo-cide
I'm doin' the Darryl Adams job
Your brother, you know?
How's he doin'?
Wouldn't know. Haven't seen him yet
That's no joke in there
You been in?
Just overnight on a confusion
Wasn't no thing
Errol. I thought you were dead
I was. I came back
Mr Barnes waiting for you?
Nah, not me
I'm not happy about this
Your brother fessed up
But it was some bullshit explanation
Ronnie, you know what he told us?
How the fuck would I know?
I wasn't there
- Wasn't there?
- Where he was telling you all this
What do you think happened?
Got me
You think him and Darryl
Had some static? A beef?
- Did you know Darryl Adams?
- No, no, no
- You didn't know Darryl Adams?
- Nah, man
I never met him, nothin'. Nah
When's the last time
You saw your brother?
- It's been a while
- Week, month, year?

Two months
Two months?
You wanna get that?
What you talkin'? That ain't mine

Some help, some insight

Good. Every week, I look out for you
I tell you when we're hittin'. Week
In, week out, you look out for me

This is my man Kirby
Kirby gonna double back in
Like 30 minutes. You lay it on him
You tell your boy Rodney
I got some good stuff he could use
Finest, highest quality
Peace out
I think you dropped this
If I was you
I think I'd call this guy
Larry
Yo, Strike
- Been waiting for 40 minutes...
- Who's here to see Victor Dunham?
You told me he was gonna
Come down a half-hour ago
Watch your tone
Young lady
Aw, man. I love you. I love you, man
- Cool, man
- You look good
After you, man
Somebody got bored shaving
So they decided
To cut me up with a razor
And they stole my sneakers, too
Yo, big brother
You made the papers, man
Ronnie...
Can you get me outta here, man?
- I'll try. What's the bail?
- 50,000

That ten per cent thing
- Maybe Rodney got...

To stop fuckin' with you
Yeah, man
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe
Look, man, I'm gonna try
To get you outta here, OK?
Ronnie, some of these brothers...
Some of these men...
They love jail, man
But all this, this ain't for me, man
I'm gonna get you
Outta here, all right?
You kiss my babies for me, please?
- All right
- Thank you
We've been open
For about a year
We've done pretty well so far
When I read about it
My heart was broken
Victor is a sweetheart
- Was he ever late for work?
- Never. Like Swiss movement
- Did he ever steal?
- No, he was honest
- Get any visitors?
- No
See him in here?
No
Victor was my buffer
He could talk and reason with them
Anybody ever threaten him?
Open up your eyes
And realise things is tough
Your shit is my rough
When you livin' in the city
Walk with your head high
Step with the bitty-bop
Got to survive
When you slam or you do or die
Cos niggers try to read through
A nigga's eyes...
- May I help you?
- Huh?
- May I help you?
- Yeah, let me the fuck in the store
This is a store, right?
People buy shit in the store
- What do you wish to buy, brother?
- I wish to buy what you got
Maybe we don't have what you want
Unbelievable. What are you
The security house nigga?
- What? They rent you by the hour?
- We're just trying to help...
Fuck that, man!
Cos I'm black, that automatically
Mean I'm gonna steal something
Nigga, I came in here
To buy a birthday gift for my mom!
But you ain't shit
And neither is this bullshit kung fu
Chinese bitch store!
Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'm gonna bring my steel
And pump bullets in your ass
Think I'm playing?
You disrespectin' me
On my mother's birthday...nigga!
Listen up, man
I G's up twice a day, man
How much you make in a month?
See this? See this?
It's a hundred dollar bill, right?
Use it in your kid's birthday

Thank you
I'm gonna kill your ass

- Nothin'
- Did that kid ever come back?
- No
- Hey, what's up, Mr Brown?

Yo, Ty, that's my landlord
Mr Brown. Say, what's up?
- How you doing, sir?
- Pleased to meet you, young man
This is Tyrone
This is my little brother
Anybody bother you, and his head's

For the crackheads my damn self
You do like your big brother
Leave those drugs alone
Hey, I got some food on the stove

All right. Peace
Now, go up the steps. Hurry up
Hey, Shorty
What you doin'? Don't touch that
Buggin'. You know anything
About what you're touchin'?
No
Little buster
Lionel Trains, right?
They was built in the early 1900s
But them cheap shits
They only ran on dry cell batteries
But, yo, after World War II
When more folks started getting
Electricity in their cribs
Boom, they made the new ones
Yeah, phat, right?
Yeah
Yo, profit's all in the cut
Don't never forget that
Yo, Shorty, if I ever see
Or even hear about you
Messin' with this stuff right here
Man, sniffin' or pipin' up...
Yo, come here, man
The word to my mother
Put a cap in your ass
This ain't no TV movie
Violence bullshit neither
This stuff out here is real
Real bullets hurt
And real guns kills you dead
See this right here?
This is .25 automatic
I keeps this for all them
Ill niggers out there
Like that one dude Errol
Now that brother's crazy
He will blast your ass
Just won't give a fuck
The messed-up thing is
That they never find the body
Just the blood stains on the ground
If he ever try to creep up on me
I'm gonna gat his ass
You best be ready
To do the same shit, too
Aw, don't think
That just cos you're 12
Small and shit
That he won't smoke you
Just last year
He caught himself a ten-year-old
I knows you probably thinking about
What Mr Brown said earlier and all
But, chill, don't even
Sweat that shit, man
He's old and po'
He don't know what time it is
This is how you get
That money right here
How do you think I got
That phat-ass train set?
From pumpin'
This white shit right here
Any fly shit you want
In this world, it costs money
And this is how you get it. Hustling
Don't never forget that shit neither
Yo, Shorty, you're smart, right?
Well, answer me this
Boss buys him a key
For $22,000, right?
Cuts it up to 3,500 $10 bottles
Boss takes 60%, $17,000 profit
Leaving up $7,000
How much for me?
My man, Shorty
Keep hittin' them books, all right?
All right
If I ever catch you playing hooky
I'll put a cap in your ass
My name is M-O
And don't you forget it
Takin' out your boys
And you don't know how I did it
Pickin' off your crew one by one
Don't step in my way
Cos I just might have a gun
May be loaded just might not be
Cos I'm a menace to society
My name not Thiggy-thiggy
But I still get hip
- So back the fuck up and just
- Chill
Cos steppin' on me
You'll be a-writin' your will
I'm like an Energizer
Can't never die
Ba, ba, ba, ba, nice try
Ha, ha, ha
I saw you run in the building
Throwing up my guns
To the ceiling
Ba, ba, ba, here I go again
Ba, ba, ba, cops are comin' in
Run into the back, man
I'm fast up the staircase
I got no time to waste
Nobody seen my face
So I leave without a trace...
Make the drops over on Smith Street
From now on
Yeah, all right
Oh, yeah, crooked-ass Jo-Jo
He said he got
Some weight for you to buy
Forget that motherfucker
Fuckin' faggot
He tapped me up for $500, too
Errol told me you talked
To the homicide cop
- How'd that go?
- It was aight
""Aight"" or all right?
It was ""aight,"" all right?
I ever tell you about
The first time I killed somebody?
Nah
Errol Barnes made me do it...
Cos it was three guys burned us
On some bogus dope
Errol's already killed
The other two, right?
We got the third guy
Be cool, man
Chill, motherfucker, chill
Ain't you all sorry
You fucked with us?
I ain't fucked with you
You're lucky we don't blow your ass
Off like them crackers down South
- Look, I hate this shit, man
- What the fuck is my name?
- Errol, man
- You're goddam right
Motherfucker
Crying like a baby
Tears, snot flying, and shit
Errol turned to me
Says, ""You got
To cap him, or I'm gonna cap you.""
Man, come on, that shit
Ain't necessary, man
I ain't gonna cap that boy
He's scared like a motherfucker
You think I'm playin' with you?
Open your mouth
You gonna take this piece...
And you're gonna put that
Motherfucker's brains out
- You understand me?!
- I got it
Go to it
I said you shouldn't
Have did that shit, man
- Come on, please! Please!
- On three, Rodney
I can't stop my hand from shakin'
- Don't you chump out on me
- I can't stop my hand from shakin'!
- Cap him!
- All right!
Please...
Don't you wish
You'd done us right?
Hey, hey, hey. Don't you
Ever, ever fuck with me, boy
Do you know me now? I'm a bad man
Errol couldn't have me runnin'
Around here knowin' what he did
Without somethin' personal
Hangin' over my head, too
Personal, Strike
Otherwise, I might give him up
Someday, you understand?
Strike, that's the reason why
I needed you to be bloody
On this Darryl thing
You hear me?
Errol Barnes, boy
Motherfucker had a sawed-off
Shotgun right in my mug, Strike
He's my best friend, too
- What's the matter with you?
- Shit!
You gotta take care of yourself
Here. Wipe that off
You OK?
You ain't seen my doctor, have you?
- Huh?
- Nah
Strike, why I got to tell you things
Two and three and four times, huh?
Why you don't want to listen to me?
You OK?
Shit
To be honest, I don't really
Give a fuck because you lied to me
Lied about what? You said Darryl
Had a drug problem, a crackhead
I asked around. The guy was clean
I was just speculatin'
That's some nasty-ass speculatin'
Damn. You're comin'
At me with mad questions
I'm just tryin'
To answer them shits
Then you said you never met 'im
Maybe just by eye, all right?
""Just by eye.""
You and him never had any static?
Naw
There's no way Victor could've been
Cuttin' through the parking lot
In the dark, and Darryl would've
Mistaken him for you?
Naw, man
Cos you and your brother
In the dark
Probably look like two peas in a pod
What the fuck you sayin'?
All black people look alike at night?
I can't even tell you guys
Apart in the day
Hey, you got jokes
- You and your brother close?
- Not really
I forgot. Long-lost brothers
When was the last time?
A month
Strike, you told me
Two months before
If you know so much
Why you keep asking?
- You know what Alzheimer's is?
- 
Some kind of beer?
Wise guy. You visit him yet?
Yeah
He's claimin' self-defence
He goes to trial with that
Those two nice kids of his
By the time he'll be gettin'
Out, they'll be goin' in
Did it ever occur to you
Maybe he didn't even do the shit?
You know who did?
Who did it?
Come on, man, I gotta go. I'm sick
- Here's my card
- Got two already
You better have that checked out
Hey, what the fuck y'all lookin' at?
Oh, shit!
You all right, man?
Strike! Strike! You smokin' crack
Motherfucker, huh?
Get the fuck up!
Get an ambulance, man!
Let's get an ambulance!
Let's get him the hell
Outta here
He'll be all right. He'll be fine
Watch it, guys
One, two, three
Let's go!
Here you go. It's all right, man
- Hit that pipe today?
- Dice that shit. He don't use
Anyone ever tell you not to do drugs?
Where do you live?
I'll give you that
Just get him to hospital
Welcome to Ahab's
May I take your order, please?
Yes
We need a Double Whaler on a bun
With cheese?
Yes, with cheese
A fried shrimp boat
One fried shrimp boat
- Two
- Yeah, two
Two fried shrimp...
Uh, could I please get my
Captain Ahab with a clam roll?
- Captain Ahab, Captain...
- What's up, boys?
Hey, it's a nice car you got
- Yeah, it's my dad's car
- How ya doin'?
Power windows
Air bags, cellular phone
Bet he paid a pretty penny for this
Oh, yeah. We were lookin'
For the Short Hills Mall
- It's not here
- No?
Come down from Connecticut
Just to buy some whiting?
Some golf balls
You buy anything else around here
I should know about?
- Some gum
- No
You like soul food?
Can't say I do
- You like to wear lipstick?
- Todd, why don't we get outta here?
McCauley does
In the back...occasionally
- You like skirts?
- Something we did wrong?
- You ever suck a black man's dick?
- Let's get outta here!
A big, 16-inch tar baby?
- No?
- No
If I toss this car and I find any
Drugs, I got 12 baboons in a cage
Who are gonna be callin'
You boys Mary all night
- Come on, Todd
- Shut up, man!
- Who's got the drugs?
- We don't have anything
- You got five seconds
- Todd's got the drugs!
- Shut up, man!
- Todd's got the drugs
- Fuck you guys, man!
- Put your hands on the car
- Take it easy!
- Fucking cocksucker!
Fucking touch him again, I'll rip
Your throat out. Get your hands up
- What's up?
- You tell me
What you up to, man?
You the one involved
In all the drama out here
How you always know
When I'm comin' out of somewhere?
Don't you know I know everything?
Didn't I tell you
To go see my doctor?
Didn't I tell you to stop
Drinkin' that Moo shit?
Yeah, you did, you did
No doubt, man, no doubt
- How you so smart and so stupid?
- Cut me some slack
I heard that Homicide came back
On you again yesterday
He ain't sayin' I'm in
He's just fishin'
You and him fuck buddies now?
- You got jokes, man
- Come on, get in, get in
- How do you feel?
- I'm all right
You better be, cos we got
Another big order come in
Hey, Rod
If God created anything better
Than crack cocaine
He kept that shit for hisself
I mean, that shit
Is like truth serum
It will truly expose who you are
I mean, you happen to be
A low-life rat bastard motherfucker
Who will sell off his newborn
For a suck off that glass dick
Crack will bring it
Right on in the light
I don't care you black
White, Chinese, rich, poor
You take that first hit
You on a mission
And that mission will never end
Even when the house
The money, loved ones are gone
They send you to the joint
You still gonna try to cop
No doubt
Only time it ends, Strike, that
Mission, when you six feet under
That's the reason I don't ever want
To hear about you using this shit
- You understand me?
- You crazy?
All right, then
Cos it's also the reason why
I ain't never goin' outta business
I'm a great businessman, Strike
And I got me the world's
Greatest product
Now you think about that
Yo, so what up?
I'm gonna see you at the store
- Go ahead
- All right
You believe I used to deal with that
Woman when she looked like somethin'?
Yeah. You didn't know that, did you?
She used to look good, right?
She looked better than she look now
- Finest shit we got today
- Let me see
- Yeah
- 50 dollars
But ain't y'all pregnant
Though, y'all?
- You got to maintain that, man
- We already know that
That's the last
I'm gonna sell to y'all
Y'all got to take care
Of that little girl
Got red caps?
I'm getting tired
Of these nickels, man
Where the dimes at, Lou?
We don't got it like that
Come on, let's do this
You got it?
I got reds and I got yellows
- What you need?
- Two yellow ones
- Want two yellows?
- I want two reds
All right, Veronica. Slow down, girl
Why you in such a hurry?
- Because I wanna get out of here
- Wanna get outta here?
- Let me see this money
- No, I said two
- Let me see the money. Chill
- I want yellow
- You want yellows?
- I want reds
It's the same shit. Both
Of 'em just to crack your ass up
- I want three of 'em
- And I said two
You notice the tablecloths out there
With the African prints?
The nice carpeting and the plants
Hanging from the ceilings?
It's all Victor's ideas
You see, Victor always wanted to make
This place like somebody's home
He treated everybody with respect
The workers, the customers...
Even the clockers
Like, you asked me
About last Friday night
We got three
Cocolo chocho face maricones
Trying to set up shop out there
Right in front of my business
I reach for my...trusty Roberto
Clemente Louisville Slugger here
And I'm ready to bash in a head
I'm ready to bash in an arm
But Victor, Victor, he says...
No, Jesus, no
Let me handle them, please
We set somebody up
In the bathroom there
Put somebody over there
As a lookout in the window
Sorry, but you brothers
Can't clock in here
This is a family place
And I need you to respect that
Here. Take these jumbo sodas
This is a Pepsi
An orange. A root beer
I would appreciate it very much...
If you would leave when
You finish your jumbo sodas
Usually they would just be happy
To get the free jumbo sodas
But on this night, Leroy pulls out
A roll this big and says...
My boss says that he'll pay you $300
A week if you let us set up here
What did he say?
Victor puts please and thank you into
Every sentence. So, it was either...
No. Please, thank you
- Or...
- Please. No, thank you
What? You tryin' to be fuckin'
Burger boy of the month, man?
Wait. Your girlfriend likes you
Smellin' like burgers?
No. My wife...
Oh, your wife, your wife
Got it. I see, OK, look
We're tryin' to do something here
I can respect that
You take your business outside
And I'll handle my business inside
You can't even smile, man. You don't
Like this job. Feel that money
- It's power
- I need you to respect that
I'm gonna miss you, man
So, I have to check the floor
I got a business to run
- So, Hay-sus...
- I pronounce it ""Jesus""
I feel more comfortable
Calling you ""Hay-sus""
My mother called me Jesus, my father
Called me Jesus. You call me Jesus
All right, Jesus. So is that why
Victor left early Friday?
He said he wasn't feeling well
- Fuck. I gotta make a call
- There's a phone out in front
Wasn't feeling well?
Would you feel well after working
It'll make you sick. Try it. Give me
Your badge, I'll give you my apron
How much cheese
You make yesterday, yo?
I made like a motherfuckin' yard
I did all right
- Yo, Strike!
- Here comes Shorty
- Take this
- Shorty, what I told you?
It's yours
I told you!
- Here comes your moms
- Oh, shit
- It's yours
- You crazy?
- What did I say? Huh? You hear me?
- What are you doin'?
You hear me? I told you!
You leave my son alone!
Don't you ever put your motherfuckin'
Hands in my face
I will put my hands
Wherever I want to!
You stop buying him shit
I ain't buyin' him shit
- Fuck!
- Go home. Go!
The Nikes
The Sega game, the haircut!
You thought you were slick, right?
I saw him riding the bike
You wouldn't let him bring that home
You best stay the fuck
Out of my face
I am not scared of you
Maybe you're scared of Andre
You get Andre. I don't give a fuck
You are sellin'
Your own people death
All of y'all. I'm not gonna let you
Take him with you
You hear me?
I can't let you do that
I can't let you do that
Can't! You understand?
I'm gonna go get Andre
She took a pop at him, the ho
Yeah, here come your friend, man
Now you're beatin' up
On defenceless women?
- What gives?
- Come on, man. She attacked me
Can I talk to you a minute?
Have a seat
Don't look so depressed
Worse things could happen
Hey, Ronnie, have I treated you
Like a hard-on out here?
What?
Have I not treated you
Like a man out here?
Talked to you
With respect, courtesy, huh?
What you talkin' about?
Why you tryin' to make
A fuckin' fool outta me?
- What you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?
You told me you
Didn't know Darryl Adams
I'm running around like
A horse's ass on that
Not only did I find out
That you know him
But you worked a year with him
At Rodney's store
Why the fuck didn't you tell me?
I thought you meant
This other Darryl
What other Darryl?
If you knew some other Darryl
You should have said
""Yeah, I know him,"" right?
- I don't get it
- I only know one Darryl
You said you didn't see
Your brother in two months
- Oh, God
- You got all kind...
What? Ronnie, don't ""Oh, God"" me
You got all kinds of pissed off
At me just like you are now
- cos I forgot you said that, right?
- Yeah
Well, guess what?
I go into the Kool Breeze
The bar your brother was in
Just before the shootin'
The bartender ID'd you
In there that night
He even remembered the drink
He made for you
Pina colada, straight out of a can
Does this ring a bell?
Why did you lie to me?
- Cos man, it's my brother
- What's your brother?
Your brother made you lie?
Tryin' to look out for him
Explain to me how lyin' helps him
He's locked up
What you sayin'?
You tryin' to pin this on me?
I didn't say that. You said that
I asked you why you throwin' me
A line of shit. Why did you say that?
Oh, man
See, you fuckin' with my words
You confusin' me
Twistin' my shits around
Me? Oh, who's twistin' who
Here, Ronnie?
All's I'm askin' is why did you
Try to play me like a jerk?
- Please, stop fuckin' with me
- What's in it for you?
What the fuck is this?
We already spoke about this shit
Hey, Ronnie! I just want to know
What you know
Am I under arrest?
Fuck, no! If I arrest you
I can't talk to you
Then the conversation's over
Fine. You don't have to do shit
But if you wanna continue
To do business here
Without Jo-Jo and his crew puttin'
Their hands in your pockets
I would think about
Takin' a ride right now
What the fuck I look like?
I ain't goin' nowhere
With your homo-cide ass
Look
Shit
Are you comin' or what?
How you doin'?
Man, you crazy, man?
I ain't goin' up in there
No?
Yo, Rocco. Yeah, yeah, come on, come
On, man. I ain't got nothin' to say
I was prayin'
You could help me out here
Because to tell you the truth
I've come completely around
To your way of thinking
- What's my way of thinkin'?
- I know your brother is innocent
If Victor was my brother
And I knew what you know
Every day of my life
Would be a living hell
You think we can do something
About this?
- About what?
- All bullshit aside
You, me, Victor, we all know
Who did Darryl Adams
Who?
Who do you think?
I don't know. You tell me
You!
- Me?
- You little fuck. You did it
I know it, you know it!
- Your brother knows it
- Shit
What's the thinkin' on this
That if Victor claims self-defence
He'll get off
Because he has no record?
His life is over!
I know it's rough out here
For young, black males
With racism, no jobs
Single parent families...
- Fuck that
- Don't fuckin' gesture at me
Have some fuckin' respect
But you're the fuckin' king snake!
You're a low-down, cold-blooded
Evil junkyard nigga...
- ..like I've never seen in my life
- What you talkin' about?
What'd you do, offer him money?
Who the fuck are you kiddin'?
You're not the Mafia
You're not even Rodney Little! You're
A skinny-ass snake motherfucker
You think you're hot shit. You ain't
Nothing but a cold, fucking fart
You don't know a motherfuckin' thing
About me
You just a racist-ass
Nigga-hating cop
You don't know how it is
For brothers
And you motherfuckin' definitely...
- Don't point...
- ..nothin' about what's goin' on
Don't you fuckin' point
Your finger at me
What's goin' on? What don't I see?
I ain't tellin' you shit
Till I see my lawyer
Listen. I talked to...
Look at me
I got something nice to say
I talked to all your brother's
People. He's one of the decent ones
Probably in his deluded decency
He thinks he's doing a noble thing
But you and Victor playin' me
For a patsy? Usin' me?
Back up with that shit
I read you like a Marvel fuckin'
Spiderman comic book!
I been inside your bald pea brain
Since you were born
You don't play me, I play you!
Fuck!
Rocco, you can't do this
In front of our house
Understand? It's no good
Strike
Strike!
You want to make yourself crazy
Goin' after someone else on this?
There's your man, right over there
Hold on
Man, get your little ass in the car
Fuck Rodney. Yo thinks
He's gonna okey-doke me
He's goin' down, Larry
Down for the fuckin' count
Take it easy
- How ya doin'?
- Fuck you, too, Rodney
- Come on. Hey! Take it easy
- I'm gonna cripple that cocksucker
I swear on my mother's grave
I'm gonna cripple him
You were supposed to be
At my spot an hour ago
What am I supposed to do?
Tell Homicide I can't talk now?
I gotta go bag up some ounces
For my boss, Rodney Little?
- He arrest you?
- Nah
Why didn't you tell him
To go fuck hisself?
Well, what did he want?
Nothin' much
You know, same old, same old
- He ask about me?
- Nah
- Huh?
- Nah. Damn
Cos I never said nothin' to you
About shootin' nobody
All's I said, you want Darryl's spot
You got to get it for yourself
- Shit, I didn't even say that
- Fuck you, Rodney
Excuse me. Who the fuck are you
Talkin' to like that?
You outta your motherfuckin'
Mind, hmm?
You think I'm one of them little crew
Niggers sittin' on a project bench?
Open your mouth, nigga
You feel that?
I put this gun in your bad breath
Smellin' mouth
I will pull the trigger
I'll splatter
What little brains you got
All over the Corinthian
Leather interior of my car

Just like I should do
But my whole world slips away
I live my life, I live it slowly
And I take my time, I'm in no hurry

Now, take your little bag
Of candy, take your little bike
And go find some friends, all right?
Damn! Fuckin' kids, man
Oh, shit!
Boogie-Down was performing
Down with the sounds called VDP
Boogie-Down was performing
It ain't no joke
Back in the days
I knew rap would never die
I used to listen
To Awesome-2 on WHBI
I used to hear all kind
Of rap groups
Before samplin' loops
Rappers wore bell-bottom Lee suits
Me and Kenny couldn't afford that
So we would go to the park
While they was jammin' to hear rap
I used to listen till
The cops broke it up
Always thought to myself
""Damn, why they fucked it up""
But nevertheless
I was in love with the microphone
And it stayed that way
Until I left home
On the streets of New York
Now I'm free
But with freedom
Comes big responsibility
I used to walk around
Driven by the force
I remember how large Super
Rhymes was when he fell off
I used to wonder about crews
That used to rock
They were large but none of them
Could manage to stay on top
Do you ever think about
When you outta here
Record deal and video outta here
Mercedes-Benz
And Range Rover outta here
No doubt BDP is old school
But we ain't goin' out...
What you want, little shou...
Yo, Ty! Ty!
You little motherfucker!
Some years went by, I signed myself
Into a group home...
What the fuck is wrong with you, huh?
You buggin'?
Shit
I don't know what happened
I've known this kid his whole life
His mother, too. Good, decent people
Now, whatever happened out there
It was a big mistake
I mean... I mean, Tyrone's never been
In trouble before. He's like...
He's like, uh, 85th percentile
On the national education test
I mean, uh...
Now this thing could ruin his life
Please
Just help him with his moms
And his statement
You know what I'm askin'
Does my son have to go to jail?
Would you permit me to talk to him?
If you talk to him, does he still
Have to go to jail?
Tyrone, you know
What you did, don't you?
- Yeah
- You know it was wrong?
- He knows
- OK. We got that outta the way
You did wrong
But you were scared, right?
You couldn't help it
My son was terrified
Tyrone, you're a good kid, but it's
Tough growin' up in the projects
Drugs, crime, peer pressure. You know
What that means, peer pressure?
- Yes
- I hear you're real intelligent
Don't your friends make fun of you
When you get straight As
Speak correct English
Attend school
Go to classes, don't hang out?
Don't they call you white boy?
Don't they call you soft because
You ain't hanging with them hard?
I know they do, but all you
Want to do is the right thing
But they keep threatening you
Threatening your mother
Tyrone
So you get a gat
So you, too, can be hard-core
Protect yourself and your mother
- Do you know the man you shot?
- Yeah
That was Errol Barnes
A stone killer
He did time
For killin' a kid your age
Here you are, riding your bike
Minding your own business
You have a gun for protection
All of a sudden
There's Errol, that kid killer
Standing right in front of you
He's got this horrible look
In his beady eyes
You see him reaching...
Tyrone, look at me
Look at me, Tyrone
You see him reaching for that .38
Stuck in his waist
You know he's gonna gat you
Then who's gonna protect your mother?
You never fired that gun before, but
Errol was about to pull that trigger
You're scared
All you wanna do is ride your bike
It's either him or you
But this killer in front of you
There's no time to think
His finger is on the trigger
Boom, boom. The gun just appeared
In your hand
That's what happened
That's what exactly happened
And when I ask you what happened
With the tape recorder on
That's exactly what
You're going to tell me, right?
Because you always tell the truth
Now, one last thing
We need to know - again, tell
The truth - where'd you get the gat?
- I found it
- Where'd you find it?
- In the bushes
- Where in the bushes?
I'm not turning it on yet
Where in the bushes?
- What bushes?
- The bushes near my building
Tyrone, you gotta help me out here
And your mama
The truth
OK. I borrowed it by accident
From who? Remember
You always tell the truth
I borrowed it by accident
From Strike
Strike?
Motherfucker!
All right, son. All right
You did the right thing
I was tryin' to give it back to him
But he doesn't speak to me any more
I keep trying...
But he keeps iggin' me
All right, son
I'm gonna put the recorder on now
You state your name
And you tell the story, relax
Just the way you told it to me
- Your name?
- Tyrone Jeeter
Oh, shit
Fuck that nigga up, man!
What the fuck you doing?
You ruined that boy's life
You fuckin' parasite!
I had nothin'
To do with that shit!
I'm tired of excuses!
Tired of excuses
- Mommy!
- You know nothin'!
""It's not my fault.""
I'm not hearin' that shit!
It's motherfuckers like you
Mugged Rosa Parks
- Who the fuck is Rosa Parks?
- Who the fuck is Rosa Parks?!
- It's hard on the brothers
- You stupid, ignorant motherfucker!
Brothers?! Brothers! Is this the way
You take care of your brothers, huh?
Real brothers take responsibility
I'm gonna make damn sure you do
I won't be fuckin' around
I'm done with that
Done with it? Done with that?
You bet you are
You are done from these streets
You're gone from this project
And you're gone from New York
You hear me?
Oh, shit!
Come on, you son of a bitch!
Yo, why don't you stomp
That nigga too, man?
- Come on, man
- Get back! Get back!
- Gonna shoot everybody?
- Get the fuck back!
Come on! You want somethin'?
You got it, man! You got it! What?
Get up
Get up, get up, get up!
If I ever see you again
I'm going to kill you!
I'm gonna shoot you in your dome
Put a gun in your hand
And say you tried to raise up on me
For this beat down you just got
Do you understand? Do you understand?
Shit!
He wants to fly
But his wings won't let him go
He wants to travel
But don't wanna go so low
Oh-oh, Daddy, when I grow up
I want to be a silent hero...
Ah, look who's here!
I was just comin' to get you
Rodney or Andre?
Rodney! Take a number, you're next!
What'd you think
You was gonna do? Become president?
Yo, man! Why did Tyrone
Do that stupid shit for?
The boy did it for you
He was protecting you
Rodney ain't no fool
He sent Errol after you
And this poor fuckin' kid
Stepped into the breach
David and Goliath
Now he's a 12-year-old murderer
Way to go, Strike
Yo, don't lay that on me, all right?
Don't lay that on you?
- I had nothin' to do with Tyrone
- You had nothin' to do with it?
Can you look yourself
In the fuckin' mirror and tell me
You had nothin' to do with Tyrone?
Why the fuck you have to come
Shake my hand anyway?
Didn't I tell you not to play me?
Did I not tell you that?
I don't give a fuck what you said!
You can't put this weight on me!
Nah, why should you carry
The fuckin' weight?
You must be a wonderful
Fuckin' guy
Everybody tryin' to protect you
- Tyrone, Victor
You know what? They all went down
Protecting you from the same guy
And he's still out there
I'm the only one
That can protect you now
That's right. Me. Me
So you tell me how Rodney
Pressured you into cappin'...
Oh, man!
..Darryl Adams
And we'll drop him down a hole
Don't tell me Rodney
Pulled the trigger if he didn't
All's you gotta do now
Is tell me the truth
Did you shoot Darryl Adams?
No, man, no. Damn
- Who did?
- Scientific
- Who the fuck is Scientific?
- He's with my crew
- Did you see him kill Darryl Adams?
- No
- Did he tell you he killed Darryl?
- No!
- Did he tell anybody?
- I don't know! Why you sweatin' me?
It was Errol Barnes!
Get up!
Get up, you fuckin' lyin' cocksucker!
You crazy?
I'm gonna hand-feed you
To fuckin' Rodney myself!
I swear to God!
It was a nigga named My Man
My brother said My Man would do it
- My Man?
- I didn't have the heart to do him!
- I didn't have the heart to do 'im!
- Victor said My Man would do it
We was in Kool Breeze and shit
A-a-and Victor
He just told me
He was like, he said, ""My Man""
Maybe Victor was so drunk
He did tell My Man to do it
Bullshit, bullshit!
Let's go see Rodney
Rocco
If you don't get your hand
Off my son, you better...
- Victor called me from the bar
- You ain't gotta tell him nothin'
Victor called me from the bar
Mom? I think I'm gonna
Do somethin' bad
Ma, I can feel it
Look, I'm just tired, that's all
I'm just sick and tired
And somebody's gotta pay
Somebody's gotta pay
He came back into the house
An hour later
Victor! Baby, what's wrong?
Oh, Mama, I shot somebody!
I shot somebody
He was throwin' up all night
I didn't even know that other boy
Was lyin' dead in the parking lot
The next morning...he says
That he can't get out of bed -
His legs are cramped, he can't walk
Mama, let me tell you
It was just like a dream
Like somebody else was pullin'
The trigger, you know?
And that's what happened
Mommy, I swear, I'm gonna help Victor
What is going to happen to my son?
Did you get the money from Sharon?
- Huh? For the bail?
- She wouldn't take it
My son Victor...
Said it was self-defence
Believe him!
Shit!
Shit
""Bitch...you is dead.""
Motherfucker stole my bags, too
Yo, Strike. Your boy Rodney
Took a piss in your car
So, where do you want to live, Ronnie?
I don't know, man. You tell me
We's goin' to the Port Authority
Bus Terminal
Please, Rocco, man
Take me to Penn Station
Same difference
Self-defence. Self-defence
Victor is pleading self-defence
So, what's up with Tyrone?
Does he get bail?
No bail on juveniles
His mother has him until the trial
So, how much time is he gonna get?
Maybe a half-year
In a youth house, if he's lucky
Yo, Rocco, before I get out, man
Just answer me this one question
Why was you so gung-ho
About all this shit, man?
Most cops...
Brothers killin' other brothers
Ain't no big thing. Blas, blas
What made you care about me, my
Brother Victor, Darryl Adams, Tyrone?
Huh? What made you give a shit?
If I ever see you again
I'll book you on charges
Of criminal solicitation
And conspiracy to commit murder
I'll let Andre beat you down again
Then pick up Rodney
On the same charges
And I'll make sure you two
Share the same cell
The same fuckin' bed
Do you understand me clearly?
Yeah, I understand you clearly
I just wanted to say thanks, for
Gettin' me outta town, that's all
It ain't mine, man
I stopped doin' that
Get the fuck outta the car
Final Call newspaper! Get
Your latest edition of Final Call!
Sir, how are you doing today? Get
Your latest edition of Final Call
Justice In Black And White, sir

Thank you very much, sir
Have a pleasant and good day

Edition of your Final Call newspaper!

""I'll kill you.""
I guess somebody read his shirt
The wrong way, huh?
Whoo!
Right through his fuckin' mouth
Another stain on the sidewalk
- Hal! Lunch
- Another dead motherfucker
DMF. All right
Well, Hal, let's go to work
- Take it away, Lieutenant
- OK. Catch you next time
Hey, guys
They should blow these projects
To Timbuktu
Why bother? They kill themselves
Anyway, like a self-cleaning oven
No fuss, no mess
That's how the Nubians do it
Cycle of shit
- Take it easy, guys
- Take it easy
What the fuck happened?
One snap, that kid
Scientific got shot up
What's a Scientific?
That could be you next
Mr Scientific
Nothin' you ain't seen
Before, eh, fellas?
Did you see anything over there?
Back in the early 1900s
When trains ran on batteries
When people had no electricity
In their houses...
After World War II, right?
- Tyrone
- Huh?
- You know I love you, don't you?
- Yeah
- After World War II, right?
- Yeah
When people started getting
Electricity in their houses
They made these - the new ones
Wanna hear a whistle?
Here is my hand
For you to hold
Here's a part of me
They have not sold
I've wandered far
I've had my fill
I need you now
Do you love me still
Only you have seen
The hidden part of me
Call me foolhardy
If you will
I loved you when
Do you love me still
So many smiles
And lies surround me
Empty expectations
Faceless fears
Sometimes this life
Is a bitter pill
I love you now
Do you love me still
You have been mine
Since time untold
Our love is immortal
Don't you know
Others will come
And they will go
But I loved you young
And I'll love you old
Only you have seen
The other side of me
Call me naive, I think you will
But I loved you then
Do you love me still
Here are the eyes
That only see you
Here's a mouth
That only calls your name
Here is a song
They cannot kill
I love you now
Do you love me still"

Mujhe lagta jann jann ke
Milti hai tu aksar
Poori qayamat hogi
Na chodi hai koi kasar
Top to bottom marks
Tujhe diye maine 10 out of 10
Kyun nai chahiye chal okay then!
Bhare club mein reh jayegi
Billo phir kalli tu
Koun sambhalega tujhko
Jab ho jaayegi talli tu
Main hi bachaunga tujhko
Duniya se kyu ki main hun strong
Jaise angrezi picture mein
Ladki ko bachata hai King Kong
Just like that bilkhul waise
Bilkhul shaktimaan jaise
Tujhko rakhunga main
Baby apni jaan jaise
O mundeyan te o mundeyan te..
O mundeyan te kudiyan di gal ban gayi

Makhna,Yo Yo Honey Singh,"Verse -
Mumbai ke baat kuj nawabi alag
2 din ma launde yha chadta falak
Usse speed ma fir idhar girta galat
Mujhe shauq, inhe ha jaatne ke talap
Ma tujhe kaise bolunga koiye baat nahi chal
Unhe baato se fir tu darega kal
Mera flow aise ke beato ho jata chal
Mehnat kara bina tu kabhi hoga nahi safal
Ma yha tak pocha chota girta girta
Tera kaam bada log ke samne chukta wukta
Ye bakwas kaam bol thoda hum nahi maal fhukta
Isse chakkar ma kho gya tu nasho ke dhun ma
Nashe bhi nakli aur londa bhi fake
1 saal ma inhe log ko bana ye drake
Tu sikh le pehle mera rap tu dhek
Rap mere knife aur puri gang tere cake
Ye gaana mere bday party hoja tu tyaar
Yha mufat milenge snacks woh 2 baar
Isliye lelo tumhe bhi thoda muhfat ka gyaan
Ma inshort bolu toh mujhe aaj kar lo bayaan
Thoda sambal le aaj tu maa ke laal
Tujhe hit hona ma lagange aur 2 saal
Scam 1992 mera role sucheta dalaal
Please chup kar jha sasta deepak kalaal

Baata purana but mera naya ye flow
Insta pe live bhet ke beta abh tu roh
Fame ke bukh badi lagi you thirsty crow
Apne career ko bhi thodi dhile toh doh
Ye gira rha neecha jaise media ke rating
Tere bandi toh kar rhi kise aur ko dating
Aaj ma bhi laga rha tera career pe betting
Woh bhi laatka hua jaise youtube ka trending
Toh bheed maat mere se tu kar le defend
Ye gaana sunke kaafi log honge offend
Inke baata adhuri jaise daru pe chakna
Ma yo yo honey singh aur gaana ye makhna
Gaano pe nachna aur baahano ko raatna
Tere aadat kabh jayege, bolo toh saach na
Ma nahi dunga tujhe, agle baar ye mauka
Toh agr karna ha waar, toh seedha saar pe kar na

Yo honeys check it out, she got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat ass WOW
Walks over, feel your feet tap on the ground
Make a *nigga* come back like ""What's happenin now?""
Hear he really promising the platinum, get down
You'll be backin it out, straight backin 'em down
With your hand on your mouth
And damn baby girl, what's that all about?
You know the ave puttin curves in the brow
On your job, all workin it out
I like how you coordinate: purse, skirt, and the blouse
Around the way, comin straight out the house
You just laid on the couch
Make a cat just pause and be ""Wow""
(Talib Kweli)
Baby's body was immaculate
Sweet like my first kiss in the back of the flick
I have to insist, miss, that we chat for a bit
But your ass wanna diss
Walkin all fast like you can't stop
I need somebody to get passionate with
You just assume that I be on that supermasculine *shit*
Crackin the whip just to shut you you and fasten your lip
I just be shinin my light and they be baskin in it
I go out casually dip trip on the tragically hit
Sippin Cosmopolitans on some fashionably *shit*
Black Star in the building and it hasta be sick

Yeah, you ain't burnin the street
Look at how we got 'em personally thiefed
Sipped on when I get open Henny
Pen strollin on the track like Bishop Don
Or filmed on the Real World
Smoke slow, no joke, one draw I kill y'all
How many times yo do I got to tell y'all?

Nommo featuring J. Rawls
Asheru from the Unspoken Heard
And Rawls
What you know about Nommo we use words and sound it's a powerful thing so gather round
And to think that this beat is in sync with the way your heart pound you gotta get up to get down
What you know about Nommo we use words and sound it's a powerful thing so gather round
And to think that this beat is in sync with the way your heart pound you gotta get up to get down
[Verse 1]
Ey yo it's asheru
Let us in on capitals
Let me spit this rap at you
You heard my Steez haven't you
No need for me to battle you
It's proven that i'm masterful
So when you initiate i tell you i'm straight
Then go after you
Bartender pass the brew
I know i got some cash for you
After this i head up town on georgia avenue
My crew roles massive
And we make jurassic classics
But now yall know the deal like Vlasik
Select the method of payment paper or plastic
No checks i have enough problems trying to cash it
You know how it is
Yo and you know why
Cause the who what when and why be telling lies
Mind stedic is what keeps you in static
The cling is eye bling inside out
When i sing it's like Ash Gordon
Verses ming the merciless
The way i leave you Birseless
I did the world a service it's..
[Hook]
One for the money two for the show yo people in the place to be just say YO
Ey yo one for the honeys two for my bros people in the place to be just say YO
Ey yo one for my dunnies none for my foes in the place to be just say YO
Ey yo people in the place to be just say
Ey yo people in the place to be just say
[Verse 2]
You it's amazing how the game was won
A check-mate to elevate the death brate
Set the record straight
Then elevate with housing
Hoes to all those
Yo i love you like fall clothes
And wall to wall shows
It's ash rhyme trainer like pokemon
The beat tamer
The tree flamer
The smoke alarm
Addictive personality
Compulsive reality
Capricorn like jesus if you really believe this
Wise beyond my years
I've been told by my peers
But i'm only just a kid
In my primal years
And now your primal fears are confirmed
With every lesson that i learn
And I'm able to teach
This is to whom it may concern
I dare you like black rhyme
I know you only tryna live but you still doing a wack job
And i'm your counselor for guidance
Know as your highness
Their like alzheimer's victims with laryngitis it's
The word
[Interlude]
Among other things nommo is an African philosophical concept that deals with the generative and procreative powers of the spoken word
Everything begins with the word you know word and sign equals power, so you just have to be careful when you speak out there cause you putting in a creation, positive and negative, you know
[Hook]
Yo, it go one for the money two for the show people in the place to be just say YO
Ey one for the honeys two for my bros people in the place to be just say YO
Ey yo one for my dunnies none for my foes people in the place to be just say YO
Ey yo people in the place to be just say
Ey yo people in the place to be just say
It goes one for the honeys two for my bros people in the place to be just say YO
One for the money two for the show yo people in the place to be just say YO
Ey yo one for my dunnies none for my foes people in the place to be just say YO
C'mon people in the place to be just say
C'mon people in the place to be just say
It go"

Bebo diyaa Gallaan… pink pink!
Kalli baithe kardisi drink…
Bebo diyaan Gallaan… pink pink!
Kalli baithe kardisi drink…
Main beh gaya kole jaake
Mode naal modaa laake
Menu kehdi what u think???
Bebo diyaa Gallaan… pink pink!
Pink pink pink pink pink pink
Mode te Tatoo Khanwaya
Fashion poora kardi
Jade khade nu yaar banaya
Vaaraan kolon dardi
Tu vekh jattan de jere
Je bhaang chapon bathere
Saade vadeya de naale link!
Bebo diyaa Gallaan… pink pink!
Pink pink! (8x)
[YoYo Honey singh:Verse]
Bebo Bebo Bebo Bebo
Bebo tere gaal gulabi, uff ye tera makeup…
Ohhh! damm baby
..
I love your mark shake
Cardio shardio maar ke baby ho gayi shape…
Saj dhaj tu kahaan ko chaldi
Kal hi hua tera breakup…
BPO mein kaam tu kardi
Saturday naal affair hai
Saturday ko party sharty, tere bhi kya kehne hai..
Night out ki baat o karde, tu toh ready steady go…
Hah!!!
Bata du tere daddy ko???
[Alfaz]
Step wang da dance floor te evy mail di jaandi
Munni nuvi maatha paave
Nachdi wardi akhhan di
Haaye haaye lakk di o gaagar
Ho gayi husna de saagar
Ji sadda heart ho gaya sink
Bebo diyaa Gallaan… pink pink!
Pink pink pink pink pink pink
Saanu lagda os kudi da nakhra leke veju
Phir taan bus Alfaaz vi yaaron ohda hoke reh ju
Ik paase hai loundi laare
Ik paase hai kare ishaare
Kabhi akh nu kare blink…..
Bebo diyaa Gallaan… pink pink!
Pink pink! (8x)
Pink pink! blink blink! pink pink!
Bebo diyaan Gallaan… pink pink!
Kalli baithe kardisi drink…
Main beh gaya kole jaake
Mode naal modaa laake
Menu kehdi what u think
Bebo diyaan Gallaan… pink pink!"

Lakhan De Pair,Yo Yo Honey Singh,"[Intro]
Yeah, aan
[Chorus]
Italy di maid, fat cigars
Pull up like a sheikh
Chauffeured cars, tailored suits
Lakhan de pair
I'm motherfucking millionaire
Foreign di deals mote dinars
I got dirty money, super powers
Munda aa rare, karda ni care
I'm motherfucking millionaire
Italy di maid, fat cigars
Pull up like a sheikh
Chauffeured cars, tailored suits
Lakhan de pair (Yeah)
I'm motherfucking millionaire (Aan, aan)
[Verse 1]
Munda top da brand agg lagi hui stocks nu (Stocks nu)
Redbull naal glasi khamb lage mere thoughts nu (Thoughts nu, thoughts nu)
Dus saal ho gaye ajj vi
Ohna de zehan ch main rent free (Rent free, rent free)
Pole dance roz main karaunda
Billo unglan te opps nu (Opps nu, haha)
Oh chaunde rеply munda dinda naiyo shit koi
Mere naal muqable ch hunda naiyo fit koi
Oh ajj vi nе label'an de rehnde jutte chattde
Tan vi mere zikr bina na geet hit koi
Aa, fan base mera jivein cult koi
Ghodiyan banaunde bole galt koi
Bina gallon nahiyon OG-OG hundi
Neetan naal geetan da result ohi
[Chorus]
Only Boss Schools, Uche udaars
Kaddi spaceship trip to mars
Banda top brand mehange ne share
Flying kisses on from everywhere
Italy di maid, fat cigars
Pull up like a sheikh
Chauffeured cars, tailored suits
Lakhan de pair
I'm motherfucking millionaire
Foreign di deals mote dinars
I got dirty money, super powers
Munda aa rare, karda ni care (Yeah, yeah)
I'm motherfucking millionaire (Aan, aan)
[Verse 2]
​Life saddi rich-rich notaan de racks mein
Oh kehnde money evil, check your facts man
Oh maarde ne rehnde chhala jehde networth te
Ohna annually methon leke jande taxmen
Alpha te sigma da munda billo mel nai
On a new level, ik minute di vi vel nai
I don’t know where je geet koi sitda
Main badeyan di hype nu haan karda derail ni
[Chorus]
Only thick chicks on radar
Fly karaan private sochaan ton paar
Kaun jaane vair, kinne affair
I'm motherfucking millionaire
Italy di maid, fat cigars
Pull up like a sheikh
Chauffeured cars, tailored suits
Lakhan de pair
I'm motherfucking millionaire
Foreign di deals mote dinars
I got dirty money, super powers
Munda aa rare, karda ni care
I'm motherfucking millionaire
Italy di maid, fat cigars
Pull up like a sheikh
Chauffeured cars, tailored suits
Lakhan de pair
I'm motherfucking millionaire (Yeah, aan)
Foreign di deals (That's right), mote dinars (He-haha)
I got dirty money, super powers (One and only)
Munda aa rare, karda ni care (It's your boy)
I'm motherfucking millionaire (Kehndi ""Yo Yo Honey Singh"")
[Outro]
Haa, yeah baby
Haha
Wooh"
